Not clear on any of his expectations. Don\'t join his class late, as you won\'t be allowed to make up any work that you missed. Wouldn\'t recommend his class to my worst enemy."

His personal ego is more important to him than his students. He is terrible at explaining concepts to the class, and has little patience for questions. Avoid at all cost. He should not be allowed to teach at UC."

He is very helpful when you have questions and although the course load is large I would not have learned as much if there was not as much work. Would recommend to anyone.
