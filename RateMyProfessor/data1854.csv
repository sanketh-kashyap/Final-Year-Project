Pearson hw and tests. LOTS of HW but easy. Do the HW and pass. Simple as that. I skipped the presentation because I didn\'t care if I got a B. Available if you need help but easy class. Very forgiving of deadlines. GREAT ACCENT. Have to buy the text because you need the online code. Only downside to her class.

She has the knowledge to teach 3 and 4 hundred level math classes but she teaches them at a low level. She wants everyone to make an A, even if you don\'t learn anything new. Therefore she challenges only the lower level students. Take her only if you struggle in math."

Dr. Mienie herself helped through tutoring hours, online helps, and what she could do, given her schedule and business, and she even assisted when the Pearson online software was either too strenuous or buggy."

She is the kind of instructor that works hard to make her students successful. Brings in materials from other resources than just the textbook to help grow as a student. She is a very kind, generous, classy lady, and is 1 of the best mathematicians I know (over 50 of them). Definitely recommend her as an instructor."

She really knows her stuff. As long as you pay attention in class and take notes you can pass the class. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but unless you have someone who takes good notes for you than you may want to attend class.
