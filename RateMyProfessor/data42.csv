This was her first time teaching this class and she did a really good job, it was easy enough as long as you studied. She really wanted you to read the book, but I was able to get good grades without them from her lectures"

Really helpful and willing to answer your questions. The material isn\'t to hard. She actually teaches and doesn\'t just read from her slides. I highly recommend her if you have to take this class. She prepares you for the tests. Give lots of optional homework. Do it and understand it you\'ll get an A.
