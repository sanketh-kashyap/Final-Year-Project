While its technically possible to not go to class except on test days its really not a good idea. Her lectures really clarify the material and are a great opportunity to get help on homework. Lots of in class example and problems to help the student.

She takes you through problems step by step until you understand the concept. She will sometimes let you have a 5 x 7 card for tests if there are alot of formulas. You do not HAVE to attend every day, but if you want to learn the material you should!"
