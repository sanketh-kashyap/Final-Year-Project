You have an assignment, discussion, and quiz/test due every other week. As long as you have read your chapters and do your work, there is no way you won\'t receive an A in here. Only required about 3 hours a week of work. Definitely take this!"

Not too bad just super time consuming. I wouldn\'t take for an easy A I just needed it to fill writing course. She doesn\'t really help with feedback. I asked multiple times if what I was doing was right and she would only say ""Ok"" or ""Yeah"". Class isn\'t that bad just a lot of time put into it"

However, she is so nice and helpful. She responds to emails very soon and is very willing to help students outside of class so that they will do well. I did have to study a lot for tests and quizzes matter."

Everything is clearly explained in Blackboard, and the class itself could honestly be finished in one day. I split it into 3 sections and was done after 3 weekends of taking time to take the quizzes. You need the book to do the assignments. Seriously you\'d have to try hard to fail this!!"

She will try to help you if you are having trouble but usually gives most of her work to her TA to grade and tutor. This is a fairly easy class if you review before the test. The hw quizzes can be hard but she gives lots of bonus and the projects aren\'t too bad either. Over all this is an easy A class

There were 5 quizzes with the lowest dropped, a paper that was not too bad and was an EASY A, two tests, and the final. She gives a lot of info but her study guide helps. I\'m pretty sure she is one of the best for 101. TAKE HER!!! But you do have to go to class, and she gives extra credit on certain days!"
