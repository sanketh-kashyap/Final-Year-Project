It\'s Professor Hassell. Class was always dynamic! It was reading intensive (and I\'m an engineering major so I wasn\'t too excited about it), but it was totally worth it. He\'s cool and laid back in class but encourages students to learn and do their best."

No exams, and you can show him assignments early to see what grade you would get. It is a writing intensive course. He is fairly liberal, not a course to ""Learn about your religion."" Tons of extra credit. Too much reading from WRT. I learned something."

That said, if you want to actually learn things with an incredibly knowledgeable, engaging, and laid-back professor, sign up for a course with Hassell. He\'s top notch - one of my favorite professors. Has extremely high standards but if you do the reading and put 110% effort into your work, you\'ll be highly rewarded."

I learned a lot from his assignments and lectures! There was quite a bit of homework but if you do it well he grades fairly.

You will feel accomplished about every task you do, as he will make you work hard for your grade, but trust me, it is worth it...

He is the most inspirational and generous i have ever met. He has changed my life to say the least and i\'ll never look at philosophy or Immanuel kant the same. This has been the best semester of my life because of this man. If youre debating taking this class, DO IT. Plus, hes probably the funniest man i know"

Some of the concepts can be hard to grasp at times. Make sure that you start the project as soon as you can, it takes a lot of time to do it right. Buy the old edition of the books, they are a LOT cheaper. I got a 4.0 but it took a LOT of effort. Don\'t take him unless you are serious."

Grades returned very quickly. Rubrick included in the syllabus. Very clear and challenging. The material is difficult but the ideas are beautiful. Excellent discussion. Be warned the professor caught several people plagiarizing who he failed. He requires arguments not opinions.

If you do the all the work you\'ll be fine. I barely read any readings because they were so complicated but if you refer back to your notes when you write your papers, You will be fine.

He expects a lot from you on papers but never explains what he wants and gives no feedback, just sticks a grade on your paper. Gives extra credit like reading an extra novel which is far more work than extra credit should be. Don\'t take him."
