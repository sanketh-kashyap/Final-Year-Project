But he patiently went through solutions anyways with people, time and time again. It can take about a half hour sometimes to type out an entire solution in the forum, and he did this dozens of times. Very patient & brilliant."

He takes attendance every class and as the semester goes on, the lectures evidently get harder to follow. The homework and quizzes are online. The homework can be repeated until you get 100%, and the quizzes can be repeated 3x. He\'s a fair grader and lets you use a calculator. Take him!"

Took this class in the summer and literally got an A+ in his class. Just do all his assignments on Mathlab and do the review problems. Gives out lots of bonus points for tests so do them all! Put in some effort and get an Easy A!

Gives out extra credit and grades fairly. checks attendance. tests correlate with homework (big plus for a math teacher). Easy A if you understand all the concepts. would definitely take again."

Class isn\'t fun but it\'s stats so what do you expect. He really is a great teacher. I got D\'s in math in high school and managed an A. It took a lot of effort though. He will answer all your questions and will stay after class. He really takes the time to get to know his students. My favorite teacher at coastline. Will miss him"
