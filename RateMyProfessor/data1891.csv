Class started out slow and vague, but really picked up and became much more clear. Not a demanding professor and does whatever he can to make life easy for his students. Easy grader; open notebook tests. I hate philosophy but enjoyed his class a decent amount. Great, unique guy"

He really tries to help all the students, even those not making an effort. Every class is worthwhile.He gets you to see your world from a different point of view. Just put in the effort and you should do fine in this class. He also posts his own class notes on blackboard. Would definitely recommend."

Very interesting and thought provoking professor. 3 essays and quizzes. He\'s a really fair grader and cares about his students. Sometimes what he has to say can go over your head, but with patience you\'ll realize how great he is."

If you are a fan of Alan Watts philosophies, this class is dynamite. All tests are open book(4) and most class discussions are very interesting. If you\'re a fan of Buddhism and its philosophy, you\'re in a good place"
