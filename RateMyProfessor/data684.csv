His UGS class consisted of 3 essays, however he grades quite hard. You CANNOT bs this class at all. He will scrutinize every word in your writing assignments. So while getting an A is quite difficult, Professor O\'Connell truly teaches how to write at an advanced level."

Professor O\'Connell might be my favorite teacher I have had at any point in my education. He is incredibly smart, really funny, and his class is very engaging. He promotes a lot of classroom discussion and he gets you thinking about historical events in great depth. He makes naval history more interesting than I thought possible."

He is more engaging and interactive than any other teacher I have had. He makes history very interesting and enjoyable to everyone. He is a smart man and will challenge you to think about things differently.Yale educated and an undercover Marine.

It definately detracted from the lesson and I dont think Marines should rate pink. That is all Sir.

He\'s really smart. I think he likes the French a little too much for a marine, but I would be willing to bet he was a motivated marine. Go Navy!"
