GROUP PROJECTS,0,0,"She\'s extremely knowledgeable in theater history. Likes to talk but is open to listen to what students have to say. LOVES to spark controversial convos. But on five separate occasions she didn\'t show for class, and either gave a 30-15 minute warning, or would email the class 4-6 minutes after class. That sucked. Good teacher but not professional."

If she doesn\'t like your work, you\'re totally at the mercy of her grading. She gives quizzes every week which can\'t be made up. She tries to be approachable, but talking to her constantly feels like being yelled at. If she doesn\'t like you, prepare to fail. You may not need a book, but the anguish isn\'t worth it."

This class actually made me feel enlightened and refreshed everyday because of her approach to teaching. She really cares about you and guides you through the material in a fun way. Can\'t say enough good things about her, take her if you get the chance!"

Since the class is about creativity, a lot is based on discussion. You are given broad assignments that are up to your own interpretation. This is a class, and a teacher, that is very worth taking."
