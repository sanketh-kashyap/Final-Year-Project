You get used to it after a while but I was annoyed by it at first. She is caring and wants you to do well, just make sure you show her your effort. Study group also helped me in this course."

Gave 2 in class test & 4 online timed open book. Gives no extra credit. Very dry personality. You will pass if you are a science genius otherwise, you will fail."
