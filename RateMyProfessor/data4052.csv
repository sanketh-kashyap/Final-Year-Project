He cares about what he teaches, his knowledge is vast, he makes it fun and interesting. Very flexible with attendance. Don\'t be fooled, this class is hard. You have to know what you are talking about to get his grade. No freebies, but always willing to work with you. Loved this class!"

He makes law interesting and fun. He actually might teach you something. Loved his class. Don\'t be fooled, tests are hard. Even though they are multiple choice, they provoke thought and you have to know what you are talking about. Would take this class agin in a heartbeat! Thank you!"

If you are not even interested in law, he makes it so much fun. He is engaged, cares about his students and is really one of the best profs at UIU. Don\'t let this fool you. He asks for work. His tests are thought provoking and you have to know what you are talking about. Final exam done as group/class project 100% 4 class"

His questions are intended to trick you on tests. And weekly papers are impossible to get a 10 on! Would not suggest taking his class at all.
