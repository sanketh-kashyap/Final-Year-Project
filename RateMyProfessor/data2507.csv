Shawn  Rice,Hunter College,English department, New York, NY,2,2.7,N/A,3.0,,5,01/29/2011,ENGENG,2.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,WORST ENGLISH PROFESSOR EVER. Who ever was responsible for hiring this man needs to be fired. He just talks and talks about nothing that has to do with English and when he does you just want to sleep. The only thing he is good for is to look at and even that goes down hill after awhile when you realize how useless of a professor he is.

What he discusses has no relationship to the reading, what so ever. His reponse papers are so annoying and he offers no feedback, therefore you have no idea how to improve for the next one. He isn\'t much help even if you ask for some, since he really doesnt care at all."

Umm.. He talks and talks and talks and talks and at the end of class your like um what does that have to do with anything.. Jus do the papers (do them well to receive good grades) and attempt to stay awake in class..

He tends to ramble but overall its interesting. His readings are interesting and he is very passionate about them."

As of teaching, he gave so many essays one right after another but all based on stories that you know personally so not bad. But if you hate to write then dont bother. Other than that, he is down to earth and a cool person."
