Incorporates current events, making the material relatable. Exam questions are fairly open-ended, allowing students to showcase their knowledge. I would take any class Dodek teaches!"

If you can land one of his courses, go for it. Very transparent in expectations and genuinely wants the students to succeed. Provides above and beyond level resources and help.

He\'s incredibly intelligent and has an awesome sense of humour. The class content is dry and undoubtedly, you will feel lost, but do his old exams (he posts those) and you should be golden. Highly recommend."

He is clearly passionate about public law but the course was not always well laid out. The textbook was bone-dry, and too much class time was spent discussing Rob Ford. Sure, that\'s tangentially public law-related, but those hours might have been better spent elsewhere."

You will also learn, and I mean learn - as you move through your upper years you\'ll think back to his lectures both in public law and legal ethics.

Gave great marks on memos and then messed ppl on the exam (maybe to get good course evaluations?) VERY technical. Pleasant to hear if you have an interest in the material. Super great at accomodating extra help to students and giving extra preparation. Cares for students to do well. Awkward in person.
