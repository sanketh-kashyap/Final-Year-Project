Very knowledgeable of his subject and explains the material clearly; like someone said, a walking textbook. Doesn\'t make the course extremely demanding as almost a respect and consideration to other course load. It\'s understandable to see why he\'s so highly esteemed; I might be inclined to take more of his courses."
