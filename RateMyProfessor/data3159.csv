I wish she was a little more strict though, especially with students who came into every class 15 minutes late. We never started on time! She was clear on all assignments and objectives. She was extremely helpful with our projects. Very friendly, easy to talk to, loves listening to everyone\'s opinions. Overall, great teacher!"

As for the instructor, she\'s pretty helpful and easy to get along with. She even accepts regular assignments by e-mail. For this, I can almost hear my brownie points flocking to her."
