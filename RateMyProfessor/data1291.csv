I hadn\'t been in school for thirty years but I made an A in his class. You just have to listen and do what he tells you with MLA style and you will be fine.

One day all we did was listen to music and do whatever. As long as you do the MLA format right it\'s an easy A. He doesn\'t really grade on content. Overall he is pretty good and I\'d recommend if you want an easy A and can listen to directions."

I did struggle to understand expectations and found some of the online material to be confusing. He is very quick to help clarify questions though. You have to read the syllabus because he gets irritated when students ask stupid questions they already had answers to. Format is EXTREMELY important!

I found his style to be quite intriguing and definitely came away with more than I previously knew.

I e-mailed him the week before a paper was due and it took him 5 days to respond. This was after i sent 3 or 4 e-mails. I e-mailed some of the students in my class and they hadn\'t gotten responses either. He doesnt explain assignments well, and grades mostly on format."
