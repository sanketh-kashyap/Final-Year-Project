That is the only way you\'ll get all the info. Watch all the videos before tests. I found that the best way to memorize. Attendance will boost your grade 5%, as long as you attend 95% of the time. You have to study hard because tests grades are the only grades."

Pay very close attention to the youtube videos, go to class and listen closely, and finally do NOT buy the book! The comprehensive final is 50% of your grade."

Lectures can drag on if you are not huge into music."

He gets side-tracked very easily and goes off on tangents about random facts of knowledge. He can be unclear sometimes which makes the tests more difficult. His syllibus is basically worthless. Work in teams to accomplish the work.

Be careful on the tests since there are few unimportant questions. Textbooks= not really necessary, but try to listen to CDs. Print pp out before class as guideline."

He also loves to show videos to help you understand what the instrument sounds, and looks like. As long as you can remember the instruments, sounds, origins, look, and pay attention in class you should do just fine."
