Come prepared by reading and thinking through the material. Much of her discussions come from textbook charts and graphs. Sierra\'s classes have been life changing and I respect her work and dedication to the class.

She talks about herself as if she\'s some prodigy. Doesn\'t cover material on exams & expects you to print out 80+ page articles each week. Awful communication & isn\'t open for any negotiation. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!!

Material covered in class is more important than textbook.

I also noticed she loved to talk about herself and her experience. Tests were awful and not stuff we had discussed, doesn\'t discuss readings, and takes longer than most profs to respond to emails."

Seek a more engaged and competent professor in the political science department"

She is a great professor and her lectures are interesting but I agree that sometimes it seems too simple. I never had to study for an exam, but at the same time several people would fail them so I understand why she is hesitant to make the class more rigorous."

Its great that we dont read off of the book. She\'s willing to help and takes the time to listen, overall very easy class. Would def recommend."

She is extremely unorganized as far as teaching. She picks random chapters from the text, out of order, and sprinkles them throughout the syllabus. None of it makes sense. Then, she goes off on tangets, failing to instruct, and then expects the class to know things that are not in the book or her lecture. She\'s horrible."

There\'s a very anti-white, racial undertone in the class. Her test questions are crazy from left-field, and she expects everyone to know things she never covered, at all. Also, she tell you when you\'re allowed to go to the bathroom. RUN RUN RUN"
