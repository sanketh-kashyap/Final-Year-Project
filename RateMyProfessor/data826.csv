He knows his stuff but sometimes if he tells you too much you may want to rage quit. But if you use the textbook and ask questions there is no reason you shouldn\'t get a B. He will answer your questions and give you chances. He\'s human. I would take him again to get the bang for my buck. This is college after all.
