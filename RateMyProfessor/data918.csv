Tests are mostly written, and some fill in the blank/MC. You will have discussions due on canvas as well. It\'s best to know some Spanish before you take this class, NOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY. I found her to be cold and not will not work with you."

The professor is nice and friendly. But I have not understood what we were doing almost from day one. This class is more geared to those who already speak Spanish and need the credit. If you don\'t already speak Spanish, go elsewhere. This class won\'t help you."

I tried my hardest and got a B, but I was satusfied with that considering I had not taken a foreign language in 10 years. Lots of quizzes, which are easy. Just make sure you attend class otherwise you will miss a lot. Overall, great professor! : )"
