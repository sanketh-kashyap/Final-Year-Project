For us, we had 2 exams+ final. Since a majority of students were retakers (Perrin victims), he allowed us to drop one exam if our final scored higher than our prior exams. Book has useful info, but in order to prep for the exams and final, STUDY ALL OF THE PRACTICE EXAMS CAREFULLY."

His class is def. time consuming and you have to dedicate a lot of effort in order to pull off an A. But he really prepares you for 140b so if you want to do well on 140b & 140c then do take him. You\'ll learn so much in his class. Go to his discussions and OH because they help a lot!

I was really nervous for this class but he made it rather pleasant. He puts all the conceptual information up on PowerPoints and then spends most of the class doing tons of examples on the board so he can go through them step by step and we can see exactly how they\'re done. Easily the best chemistry professor I\'ve had.
