Lectures are heavy, get ready to read and write because you\'ll be tested daily in class through clickers and her midterm is over 8 chapters and her final is over 16. I was a walking textbook in her class and it made me hate education."

The final is over 12 chapters and only 100 multiple choice questions so its hard to pass. I have loved speech pathology for years and her class made me hate the material. Does not teach, only has you copy notes every single class. Also quizzes over material you havent learned. If you can get another prof, do it."

She made me love the class because she made it interesting. The book and class notes went right hand in hand which made it easy to study for the exams. She is my favorite just because of how genuine she is.

She gave open book online tests for middterm and final. She put a lot of time into preparing for this class. It was a huge class but she put us in groups that we sat with and worked with all semester. As an aspiring teacher I find myself analyzing professor\'s teaching ability and I felt she was really good.

She\'s willing to modify classes to fit student needs. Very helpful and not too hard; but you learn everything you need. Very good prof. Don\'t worry about long classes; she gives breaks. Looks just like Ellen Degeneres...
