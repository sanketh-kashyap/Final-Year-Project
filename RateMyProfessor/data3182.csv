This class is a lot of work but he walks you through it and is willing to help with anything. It\'s not an easy A type of class due to the workload but the work itself isn\'t that difficult, just tedious. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but I would recommend attending all classes. There is group work in the class."

Without a teacher who\'s really passionate about this subject, this class would be terrible. It\'s a lot of work, but it\'s pretty easy and just busy-work. He mostly grades on structure and if you completed what he wanted for papers, not so much on the grammar and flow of the paper. He\'s really nice!"
