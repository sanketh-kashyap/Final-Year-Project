Ann  Rhyan,Ohio Northern University,Business department, Ada, OH,0,3.0,N/A,1.0,,1,02/08/2009,ABUS240,3.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Professor Rhyan\'s class is very easy. She\'s kind of confusing because she doesn\'t clarify stuff right away. She\'ll give you something then a few days later explain it. Also, she\'s not near assertive enough which means the class just kind of gets out of control. The quizzes are easy and the paper is a little challenging, but not too bad."
