I had an issue with some of my online courses and out of all the professors that I reached out to, she was the only one who truly helped me with my problem. I wish all professors at SFU were like her who genuinely cares about the students."

Teaches with even balance between reading+speaking. Tough language, so you need to put in the time. Completely fair marker; I got a B but was taking 6 courses my first semester while working, would have gotten an A or higher otherwise. Clear, informative and interactive lectures. 2 cheap texts for each level, with workbook"

She gives a short ltmd time for the quizzes, which I think is way too hard (full page,about 3 paragraphs of chinese reading)& fill in the blanks, even as a chinese heirtage speaker! I hoped that we skip the textbook & teach more aboutchinese cultures"

Really good at teaching always able to help. Most importantly, she is so clear; it\'s impossible to misunderstand her. One of my favourite profs."
