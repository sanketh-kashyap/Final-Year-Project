She was to much! 1700 points for only 1.5 credits is ridiculous. This should be an actual creditable nursing class not INTRO to nursing. I had to work extremely hard to receive my A and there was. No space for error. She never returned my call only email. stay away!

Even though she is very nice her lectures are horrible. She jumps around so much and breezes through the power points that she misses a lot. Half of the stuff on the study guides are never covered. Tests are not that hard.

She wants everyone to succeed in the program. She makes sure everyone understands what she\'s teaching before she moves on to the next topic. Her tests aren\'t that hard as long as you do the readings. I would take her again.
