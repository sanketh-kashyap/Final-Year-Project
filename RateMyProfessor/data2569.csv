Took 2 classes with Byron as my professor and those classes were fun. He was cool and wasn\'t harsh as other teachers. He helps the student to the most of his ability. Great teacher, Great class! :D"

He gets upset very easily and takes things to personal. Unmentional things where said in the class room that he allowed because that made him what he wanted to be ""cool"". He writes his own test which make no sense."
