If I ever had any questions, he would answer them. The grading is simple and if you put in effort you can pass the class easily with a B and if you put a little extra its easy to get an A. Grades homework late but posts solutions so you have to be a little proactive. Great Overall!"

He has been persistently late on grading homework and not consistent with grading criteria. He doesn\'t explain anything for labs and many of the labs need clarification on what you are supposed to be doing. Late homework is zero points.

Consistently late and unprepared. Use old notes that didn\'t correspond with the required text, homework or exams. Never gave feed back on any labs or homework, which didn\'t help much preparing for tests. Changes grading structure at week 9 because he was too lazy to give weekly quiz. Don\'t waste your time or money."

Hands down the worst experience at PCC. Uses two different textbooks and own made up material. Makes difficult subject way harder with no class structure or organization. No idea what to study and tests are a grab bag of random stuff, often not covered in class or in textbook. Could not and would not recommend to anyone."

Kleck is a Kafka-esque nightmare of stilted lectures which do not correspond to the text, tests with tricky wording or some where\'s Waldo schematic detail which you must notice to answer correctly, and no feedback on homework or labs -EVER. I feel like Josef K. after taking this course!"

I\'ve never known a professor to take cell phone calls in the middle of a FINAL EXAM! And counted down how many students were left taking the exam (LOUDLY). Practice exams were pointless because none of the material even showed up on the actual Exam. Worst professor I\'ve ever had! REFUND PLEASE!

Jeff was distracted and came to class disorganized and unprepared. We used D2l for this class and Jeff was very ineffective with posting files, grading hw and tests. There was no feedback on hw or labs the entire quarter . Lecture format was pp slides from a textbook not supported by class(Floyd). Not recommend !"

Jeff makes it fun and always has an interesting answer or story to illustrate the concepts. I really enjoyed this class, but you have to do the work to get the grade."

He is a good prof. who works full time as an engineer and teaches part time. He knows the material very well and was able to answer any questions I had easily. He has a friendly disposition and the classroom atmosphere was pleasant as such. I wish I could bring him to PSU for further digital classes! Thanks Jeff!

He is able to use great examples and analogies to really help you understand the information. He is completely willing to go OUT OF HIS WAY to help you if you ask for help. I wish all my teachers were a Jeff Kleck.

The material is kinda dry but he makes it interesting. Homework and tests were somewhat difficult but are open book. He is very helpful if you have any questions and I would recommend him if you are taking this class. He is also knowledgable in engineering.
