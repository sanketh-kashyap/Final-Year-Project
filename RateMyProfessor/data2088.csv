The exams were difficult and she never gave enough time for them. Homeworks once a week. She always seemed very mean and unapproachable. The notes are pretty straightforward if you pay attention though

She was very helpful, always stopping class to see if there were questions. Good teacher, but the course is taught from the textbook. Tests have limited time though, not too hard if you know what you\'re doing otherwise you will run out of time. Do the homework and go to class and you\'ll do fine. Got A-"

All of the exams are too long and you have to study hard to keep up with the class.Not a easy professor..

She will make u work like its an orgo class. Her exams are EXTREMELY HARD. Her notes r confusing.Other section covered only till CH7 while we had to do till CH11. The amazing thing is dat she isnt even a professor, she is just a GRAD TA. Friendly suggestion, DONT EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HER."

Constantly made mistakes. All of the exams were too long for the time given, she always apologized, but never changed a thing until the next semester when the class was a breeze. Had I known before signing up..."

She does occasionally make mistakes in her lectures, but if you pay attention, you should be able to catch it. She works out the examples in the textbook and asks if anyone has any questions right at the start of class. Her exams are easy too since she basically reviews everything you need to know."

She makes a lot of mistakes in class, and is rude. She\'s not very helpful when you go to her one-on-one. The textbook has been the key to me doing well in the course."

She was very rude to the students and refused to put much effort forth to help them. She didn?t actually read the papers she was supposed to grade ? she just skimmed them looking for important words and was very inconsistent with the grading. I hope for future students that the department never lets her teach a course.
