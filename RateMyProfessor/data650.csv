She is confusing to understand & the class is pretty boring but she is super understanding & gives you the chance to re-submit all of your tests. If you communicate with her she will work with you, even let you take a test late if you cannot make it for some reason."

Her accent is sort of difficult to understand at first, but overall, if you pay attention and attend class, it\'s not bad."

Overall if you put the effort in, she will reward you. Very understanding teacher, a bit hard to understand at times, but is always willing to repeat. I learned a lot from her consumer behavior class, and she is also a good advisor. Go for it!"

The simplest task will take her 3 classes to explain and by the end of it you\'ll wide up more confused then when you started.

Sometimes a little to slow, tends to repeat alot. Once you are used to her accent it isnt bad. Overall pretty easy"
