I learned a lot and it is a lot better than what I have heard about other ASU 101 classes.

He\'s enthusiastic about his major. This class is pretty standard compared to the other ASU 101 classes. You have to write a one page paper on each guest speaker and then there\'s a group presentation in the end about a BME topic you\'re interested in.

He was in the lecture part of the class. He is lectures were clear and he always encouraged students participation in class and had activities to support the material. I cannot say much about how hard are his tests since he did not have any. We were only graded in the lab homework.
