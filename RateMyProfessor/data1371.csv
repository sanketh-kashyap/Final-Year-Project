And if you\'re a dude, you\'d be glad to know that she\'s pretty cute. I got a good grade but I also did all of the assigned readings so I would say you\'re going to have to earn it."

Her class is 100% lecture, she talks fast, and nothing is written on the board. BUT, if you pay attention, you should do fine because she repeats everything. If you have a question, ask and she will answer it. There\'s reading to do, but it\'s never anything extreme. Take her for politics."

If you pay attention and do a bit of work outside of class, you will enjoy it and learn a ton. She repeats everything you need to know for tests hundreds of times throughout the semester, so just pay attention."
