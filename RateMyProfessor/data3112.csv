At the beginning of the class he can seem like very impersonal but as people drop he becomes more chill. So just hang in there and you\'ll be ok."

Can\'t explain anything, won\'t tell you the type of problems to expect on a test, gives weekly HW quizzes that are designed to catch you by surprise and destroy your grade. His tests would be reasonable if you knew what you were supposed to go and teach yourself. Be ready to teach yourself EVERYTHING."

He\'s a nice guy and is funny at times. He seems to know his stuff really well. His lectures are structured and organized. He is pretty good at explaining the math and concepts. He has an accent and struggles with English at times. Don\'t miss class or be late. So far so good though.
