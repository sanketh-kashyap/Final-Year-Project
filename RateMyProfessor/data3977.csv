Had her for introduction to Latina/o studies and it was a mistake. Expect to read a lot and to never expect knowing what you will do in future classes. her syllabus is useless since she never updates it from past years. 10 page research paper, presentation, test, and essay portion is all part of your final.

She teaches through group discussion, and it actually works quite well. You will have to put in the work to get the grade, but she is very fair and understanding. Her class will spark insights that you have never had before. Lots of reading, but honestly an awesome class. No textbooks!"

She always takes her time in and out of the class room to help out students on course work or be there for personal counseling, which you do not see in many professors now a days. A very humble and comical professor and one of my favorites!"
