No conservative challenge to her way of thinking. Stalin and Castro would be happy to put her on their pay roll. Indoctrination at its finest. Everything is based on her own beliefs if you don\'t believe what she does then you will fail the test\'s and quizzes.

She counts on you to do the readings but her inspirational classes tie it all together perfectly. She is there for students for any extra help they may require and made communication very open. I would strongly recommend taking one of her classes.

Great person but somewhat confusing as a teacher. IF you go to class, put in average effort, and respect her, she will help you and take it easier on you. Mix of notes/book. Quizzes are m/c (mostly from book) and Tests are papers. She also drops the lowest quiz grade. Worth taking."
