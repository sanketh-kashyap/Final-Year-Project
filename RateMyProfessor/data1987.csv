He is the best theatre professor the department has to offer. I loved his classes no books just his knowledge from yrs of experience. Very people oriented, never in a bad mood. Great human being."

Anyway, I realize that his grading is kind of unfair and his remarks on your presentation depends on what mood he\'s in. Be careful!"
