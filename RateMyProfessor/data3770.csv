There are five exams over the terms and names of people in the book. As long as you study those you will do fine. He does offer a paper in exchange for your lowest test grade if you need to. I really enjoyed his lectures. He made the class interesting and knows what he is talking about. Great class

He is very engaging and enjoys teaching Juvenile Delinquency. He also works in the field, so the dude knows what he is talking about. Lectures are solid. He keeps your attention. Know the terms (50) and you will pass tests (5) with no problem. He is more than willing to help you understand. Lots of stories and humor."

You don\'t have to talk but it is encouraged. All his test are off the terms in the chapters and a few people. Its all memorization, so its not hard at all. He also helps you to reschedule if you can\'t make it to the test. Awesome Professor!"

I was moderately interested in the class and after taking him I have considered a job with delinquents. There is a lot of discussion and everything is from the book. He tests the key terms and over people mentioned in the text. Tests every 3 weeks.
