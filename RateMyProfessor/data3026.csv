Not very enthusiastic, although the content she had to go over wasn\'t the most exciting anyway. When she showed videos it was the best. Definitely go to class."

You do have a few papers to write, and comparing papers, I dont believe she graded fairly. She has favorites and she is HORRIBLE about replying back to Emails. She seems like a nice person, but I think she thinks that everyone that HAS tot ake her class is for training reasons."

My class only had something like 2 assignments; a paper and the final. Both were really easy...

Her lectures seemed almost word for word out of the book. She gave a rubric and didn\'t seem to use it. I felt like she treated the class like we were in Jr. High.

Gives you a rubric for your paper then grades with a different one.
