She does one Le\xc3\xa7on a week and if you have the MTWTF class, you often get F off. She assigns online HW each week, but it helps A TON for the tests. If you forget a week, she gives one HW amnesty day. She is really nice and very helpful! She is a VCU alum. and studied/worked in France for 10 years! She know her stuff! Prof. Gore rocks!"
