Why even have office hours? His projects SUCK."

Pretty much just copied the book in to a power point and tries to read it to the class. Smart man but very hard to understand and asks questions that are not fully understandable for quizzes and tests. Study the power points as the quizzes are directly related.

He doesn\'t curve his grades, and many students repeat his course."

He is knowledgeable and smart, and very friendly. Helped me a lot. He has this accent ..but you get used to it by the end of the second week. His moonbuggy class made my life different and I recommended it to couple of kids. They seem to like it either"

His way of getting the information across is obviously not working. The whole class is failing. Very hard to understand since he\'s originally from Russia. Usually curves the grades, otherwise everybody would fail"
