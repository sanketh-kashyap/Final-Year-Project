Claire  Yan,University of British Columbia - Okanagan,Engineering department, Kelowna, BC,6,2.9,N/A,3.2,Caring (1)  Respected (1),9,05/08/2015,490,4.5,3.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,Yes,B-,RESPECTED  CARING,0,2,"Claire Yan has really improved her teaching style since the first year I had her back in 2010. She\'s enthusiastic, helpful, and I feel like she\'s really looking out for the students. She bubbly and even tries to encourage class participation during tough morning lectures. If you had to choose her course, do it. Exams are fair and conceptual based."

If you attend class, take notes and are reasonably intelligent you will do fine. Mech Eng students will see her a lot so be sure to go to her office for all the Clarifications. Exam questions are closely related to assignments and lecture examples."

If you listen closely and follow along, she presents material very well. Very nice person too!"

Needs a lesson in English because her communication is poor. Never answers questions properly and just confuses you more. She doesn\'t explain what she is teaching at all.

Very helpful, has lot of office hours, so very approachable. Exams made by her are neither too hard, not too easy. Method of delivering the lectures is very good, explains everything with lot of examples. Overall not the best prof. but not that bad, as other people have mentioned here."

With this decision being the first one you\'ll make all semester this teacher is horrible!"

She doesn\'t teach, she rambles on while being incomprehensible and then if you ask a question about what she\'s saying, she just repeats what she said and ignores your question essentially. Run while you still can"
