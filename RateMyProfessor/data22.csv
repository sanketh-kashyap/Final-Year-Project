Basil  Maduka,Montgomery College: Takoma Park/Silver Spring Campus,Sociology department, Takoma Park, MD,1,2.4,N/A,3.0,,5,08/23/2010,SOC101,2.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"He\'s dedicated as a person, but I found it hard to get much out of the class. Day 1 began w/ him stating factually wrong info and got upset when we showed him info on computer. Didn\'t get much better from there... he tried hard and I respect him for that, but too many rants and rather narrow opinions."

He was rough on the lazy slackers who were absent, tardy, or didn\'t turn in assignments. He was there for me every single time I asked for help. Sit up front to hear him easier. He has some interesting stories to tell if you can catch him out of class. -Paul S."

I got an A in the class, but considered dropping because I felt so miserable about the inappropriate, out-of-line things he was saying, and his insistence that his beliefs were the only possible or right ones."

Not very hard, take the class and suck up for a B but don\'t expect anything enlightening.. He\'s a nice guy though, really funny but the class is not worth the money if you want to learn."
