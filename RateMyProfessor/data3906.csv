It is extremely boring and you have to do 12 hours of volunteer work. There\'s homework due like every class and it\'s always essays. Way too much work for just a GE class.

Not intimidating because the study guide covers 99% of the questions from the exams; rest are peripheral questions. Five MAJOR assignments, most of which are only 250-word easy assignments ;). One 800 word research paper towards end of semester. Extra credit. No stress AT ALL for an easy A!"
