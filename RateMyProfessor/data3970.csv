PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,Dr. Pace was very understanding and easy to work with. There were many opportunities for extra credit and she made the learning environment very comfortable. However a majority of her 111 class was speaking French as opposed to just learning sentences and what words meant. Overall great professor.

She is extremely sweet & kind, but I dreaded coming to class. In class we don\'t really learn we just speak. Which was hard for me because I hadn\'t had French before. I wish she would have taught more. It was embarrassing being called on all the time and not knowing. She is willing to meet out of class."
