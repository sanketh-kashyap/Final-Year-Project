Jill  Greenwood,Pacific University,Art History department, Forest Grove, OR,0,3.5,N/A,2.0,,1,08/14/2010,ARTHI270,3.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Jill is a mediocre prof who seems to genuinely like the subject but the class felt like a return to high school. It was too memorization-regurgitation oriented and I didn\'t feel that I learned a lot. Her grading seemed to be subjective depending on the student and sometimes focused too much on grammar/structure than content.
