Dalanya  Bowman,Metropolitan Community College,English department, Omaha, NE,3,4.3,N/A,3.0,,8,07/29/2012,ENGL1010,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,She is a very nice and fair teacher. I wanted to take her for comp II if she taught it. I took her online and it was very straight forward and easy to understand and good on time. There are only 2-3 things due a week and each assignment takes 10-30 minutes. Very good for an online teacher. NO doubt is she the best online teacher out there.

She\'s easy on the grading and doesn\'t expect you to write a new york times best seller. As long as you show interest and effort this will be an easy class.
