It was an online course, but I feel she prompted me to take initiative and learn a lot. She\'s very helpful and always prompt in answering any questions (and in returning your grades!)"

Otherwise don\'t come near this patient, understanding, and hard-working woman. She is just personally GREAT- in need of great praise and reward. If you come to every class and study somewhat even if you have a hard time she\'ll cut you a little slack because she appreciates effort."

Really is just fantastic"

Very difficult to work with, would not recommend taking this class if you have a life, family, or job out side of school"
