He can not function with out the computer and PowerPoint but doesn\'t know how to navigate them. Talks in a fast, monotone voice that drops off as he speaks, leaving out the end of the sentence. Doesn\'t provide feedback or help when asked. Refers to non existent directions for all questions. Smart but can\'t teach"

The grading is unclear. I think the class would be more bearable if there were any inclass activities. The case study was long, but he gives you two weeks to do it, and it is doable. All the tests are open-book so you just need to be familiar"

Every class is a power point about 50 slides long. He flips through them so fast that it is impossible to take notes. All of the notes are put online so class is not mandatory. Go to class to hand in homework and take your tests. If you do that, you\'ll get a good grade."

I asked numerous times for help when i did not understand something and he told me to refer to his directions. The class is boring, and his Power Points are available online. I could stay home and read them and I would be fine. His case study was difficult."

I could not pay attention for more than 5 minutes. He is not helpful AT ALL and he is not very energetic while speaking. He is obviously very smart, but he needs to be more helpful because he tells you to refer to directions if you tell him you don\'t understand. I will NEVER take another class with him again."

You think your professor is boring?!? I don\'t think I\'ve ever had ANY professors as boring as him! Monotone! He\'s easy on grading, have outlines for class and study guide for exams. So basically, you can stay at home, read the textbook and study from his notes, and you\'ll pass! He goes over notes you do not even need!"
