If you can pass this class, you can pass any tax course at UNO. He really walks you through the chapters in great detail. Take good notes, pay attention, and ask questions! He is a very intelligent teacherlawyeretc. and he will grill you on exams, but that\'s how the game goes. Even though he\'s tough I\'d take him again."

The class is difficult and requires intense preparation and understanding, before walking through the door. Not a class for those not truly interested in taxation."

The material, corporate tax, was interesting; but the approach he used, making us think in terms of mutli-million dollars and the consquences if we as CPA\'s made a mistake, really droove home the absolute need to know the material. Fascinating, real world pro."
