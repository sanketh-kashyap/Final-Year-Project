There are tons of movies to watch and a lot to read. Exams are very specific. The professor is very hard to get ahold of so questions go unanswered for quite a while.. I would not recommend this class if you don\'t have to the time to put into it

I wouldn\'t say it was easy or hard but she is a lenient grader because I got a better grade than expected. I learned a lot about Native Americans and appreciated it because it led me to find a greater meaning behind their position in human history.

Literally had a huge paper, a field experience paper, and FIVE take home essays for the final all due within the last two weeks."

Too much on her plate, and she can\'t handle it. I was confused the whole semester because her directions are unclear. She\'s a scatter brain and the slowest grader on the planet. I would never take a class with her again. Trust me, you will hate it."

I did not enjoy her class. We watched way too many movies, and spent too much time on usless subject matters."
