Randolph  Haines,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,5,3.2,N/A,5.0,,3,01/04/2014,LAW653,3.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Prof (Judge) Haines is a great Prof. He is challenging, so if you don\'t want to work and stay on top of your readings, don\'t take his class. His class consists of a lot of hypo problems which you work through. At first, I disliked it, but then I found it SO helpful! Great way to really understand the material. He\'s great and I\'d take him again!"

If you\'re not willing to work hard in his class, you should not bother signing up for it. But if you enjoy being challenged and learning at an extremely high level, you will love this class. This was one of the best professors I\'ve ever had; he blew my mind every class!"

He constantly asks ""what is your authority for that?"" but gives answers in circles without answering many of the questions he asks. He doesnt teach logically but in a roundabout way. Be careful."
