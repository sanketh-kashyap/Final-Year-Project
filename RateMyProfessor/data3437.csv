CARING  LECTURE HEAVY,0,0,"Leila is a really motherly professor, she loves to get invested in her students. I think for some students its really offputting but I found the more I opened up to her the more she had to give, sadly - she has very little control over groups. but one on one she really is there for you and guides you if you want to pursue in performance art."

She\'s incredibly hard to get clear feedback from and is controlling to the point of extreme frustration on the part of the students. Keep your head down, don\'t get too invested in the final show (because the students wont have much say - its all her.)"

This class/prof is a creativity drain pipe and is most helpful in boosting one\'s propensity to be a narcissist. Far too much self-reflection promoted & not enough critical engagement. Constructive criticism is frowned upon and muffled, one of her biggest detriments."
