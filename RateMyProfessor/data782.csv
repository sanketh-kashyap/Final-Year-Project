She was always willing to go over things again if someone did not understand it. The lectures may be long but they are well worth learning how to do what needs done to pass the class. I dreaded this class but I am thankful she was the one teaching it, if not I think I would not have done as well."

Although the topic is a little bit complex for me, she clearly communicates, checks in with us frequently for understanding, and we generally feel like she cares about our success in learning the topic. She is a true asset to the University, and a very very good teacher. Highly recommended"

Very clear in her lectures and willing to help if you need it. Held review sessions before every exam and offered extra credit near the end of the semester. And pretty enough to keep my interest in a class I had no interest in lol.
