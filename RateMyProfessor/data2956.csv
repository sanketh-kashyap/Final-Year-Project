Key to his test since they are always blue book KNOW THE DATE ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN, WHO WROTE IT,and WHY IS IT IMPORTANT. you will write three papers aswell, one on a movie, one on a book, and one final essay about whole course."

He was energetic and nice, but only take the class if you can handle the work load."
