Cynthia  Camilin,Western Washington University,Art department, Bellingham, WA,9,3.1,N/A,4.1,Gives good feedback (1)  GRADED BY FEW THINGS (1),9,01/12/2018,ART325,1.0,5.0,Mandatory,Yes,No,A,,2,0,"Dog-eat-dog mentality, will hand you \'L\'s in front of the whole class and gives you more assignments than you can possibly hope to finish. She also made us read and respond to all these 60pg articles and have hour long discussions that cut in on painting time. Basically, a mom that you try to strive for her approval but will never ever ever get."

She is a very confident woman and doesn\'t like excuses. If you\'re looking for a relaxing art class don\'t sign on for Cynthia, but if you want to see your art grow exponentially she is the one to take."

She will make you stretch yourself in your abilities. In her class you learn to dig deep into your passion and push it to the limits. I love being in her classes. She has taught me so much and it is professors like who help students achieve great things. Don\'t be lazy work hard and take her class

The professor is very clear and cares that her students learn and improve. The first two projects were tedious but useful, and the third was more creative. I would take her class again, but not at the same time as other difficult classes."

If she doesn?t like you, your grades will show it. Horribly unapproachable. Even in her intro classes she expects you to know how to do everything. You are on your own in her classes so expect to teach yourself. Don?t take the abuse, skip on her classes."
