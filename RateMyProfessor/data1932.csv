Sandra  Hendrickson,Victor Valley College,Nursing department, Victorville, CA,0,5.0,N/A,3.0,,1,06/13/2012,NP0,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Sandra is extremely helpful. I am just sad she isn\'t a professor of the program, but a facilitator of lab activities. She has a mild demeanor and is fun to be around. She makes learning exciting. Although she requires you to know your stuff, she doesn\'t make you feel stupid or put you down like other professors in the program."
