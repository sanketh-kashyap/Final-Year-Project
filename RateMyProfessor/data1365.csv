She is truly a person who has tons of tidbits to share."

Rhetoric is not my favorite subject but she helped me a great deal. She has a passion for rhetoric and for her students to succeed. She is caring and friendly and always has a very warm smile.

When the reading got hard, like with Chaucer, she would stop and help us understand what was going on. It was a survey class so I expected to have a lot of reading and have it be fast paced. It was clear that she understood and liked the subject."

She was always available for questions and I liked the way she moved around the classroom. So many professors are so boring. I learned to be a better writer and would recommend her to anyone.

I learned more in this class than most I have taken at this University. Her tests are challenging, but she is fair. I didn\'t know what to expect, because the material was so new, but I liked being challenged to think. I would most certainly take her again."

The assignments were pretty open ended, but I didn\'t feel like I learned all that much in her class. I wouldn\'t take her again. She\'s too hyper and she doesn\'t slow down. She has too many notes on the screen to write them all down."
