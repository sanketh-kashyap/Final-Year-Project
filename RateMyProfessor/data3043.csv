A really nice guy who cares about his students! Set up everything for people to follow with slides, discussions, and movies. With this, the midterm, paper, and final were all doable, just put in the effort and you can pull off B+ and above no problem."

Midterm, assignment and final were very straightforward. You can put in minimal to reasonable effort & get an A+."

Midterm and final very straight forward format. The material he tests you on is based on his slides. I handed my paper in a few days late and the quality was not my greatest, NO PROBLEM! He still gave me 100%! Highly recommended :)"

Prof apreciates and incourages in-class discussions, the exams are not too hard, rather straightforward. He`s very resorceful on supplementing the course material with real life examples. Attendance is not mandatory but helps a lot for the exams."

He explains better than the textbook. His exam and midterms are simple. His term paper is mark booster, as the class average is 80+ for the papers. Do what he says and you will do fine."
