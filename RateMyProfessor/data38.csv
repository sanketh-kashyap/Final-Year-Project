She does not do a good job explaining and her tests are pretty challenging. The only reason I passed this class was from doing well on the essays and doing extra credit. This class is 3 hours long, which is ridiculous for a pysch class because it is way too much information to retain."

Her assignments are very easy though. Make sure you keep up on the reading because the material can get difficult and confusing if you dont."
