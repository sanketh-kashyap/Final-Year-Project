She loves talking to people about genetics. Does have online homework, online quizzes but if you find someone in class to do the homework with it makes the assignments easy.

Although she\'s a very nice woman, she\'s not good. Her lecture slides are virtually useless and vague. While her tests are specific on minute portions of her lecture. Be very careful if you take her class, write everything she says and pray she doesn\'t test on something random in the photos on her slides."
