He really tries to engage students and provoke discussion. Downside is that a lot of the assignments are time consuming and he keeps the class until the last minute consistently."

One fairly easy homework each week that are an easy A as long as you follow the instructions carefully. I never took notes in class b/c all of the information we needed for the Midterm and Final was on the Slides he posted online. Our Final was a take-home that had questions/answers word-for-word from the study guide.

Late grading, very lax turn in schedule and easy A. Just do the work and use the book for the homework and you will be fine. Mid and final were open book online."

BUT! Dr Camp constantly was late on grading. Was inconsistent with how he graded and the final grade was off for alot of people. Take if you have no other option honestly."

He genuines means it when he said hes not trying to trick but actually wants you to learn the material. show up to class he gives random ex credit its awesome

TAKE HOME exams. no textbook use for this class. students actually applaud him on the last day of class. take him

Sure he was a tough grader on the homeworks but we could redo them every time. His exams would be impossible, but he allows a cheat sheet and gives previous tests on bb that are exactly the same; do the math. His class is very interesting and he loves the computer nerds! Recommend for an easy A."

He did occasionally contradict the book; but honestly that was the most poorly written textbook I have *ever* seen. Class was fun; if you can keep it light, he can take a joke and if you can write well, essay Q\'s are a (lengthy) breeze"

He confuses himself when he tries to explain things, teaches from wikipedia and doesn\'t use the book at all. He spent 20 minutes on his cell phone in the middle of a lecture talking to his mom. Homework assignments go way beyond the material covered, tests are BS. I didn\'t learn anything in his course."

He\'ll give you the most unfair grades, even when you answer the questions right. Do NOT take this guy unless you\'re an electrical engineer. He makes it impossible for newbies to learn the material."

If you\'re a big fan of true/false and multiple choice exams, skip this guy. He wants to pick apart your two page reports and exam essays because you ""didn\'t explain the concept clear enough"" when the truth is he\'s very unclear about what he wants to receive. An absolute NIGHTMARE."

Exams are essays, and the questions are so ambiguous that even if you answer right, if you don\'t answer HIS way you\'re wrong. He makes plenty of mistakes when he explains things, and his lectures CONTRADICTS the textbook!"
