You always know where you stand. If you do your part she will meet you half way. If you think you can blow off reading and classes, you picked the wrong instructor!! She knows her stuff and she\'s great at what she does. Only slackers have a problem with her!"

I took it online. I was an accelerated course so it was a lot of work. But if for some reason you need some help or an emergency happens and you need more time to submit your work, she will not help!!"

She complains about lateness but was always late to the classes we had she didn\'t know how to use blackboard and held us liable for her tactfulness . She knows her work and could be a good professor if shed stop trying to be a lawyer in a Business class. Horrible if your signed up drop it ASAP!

She loses homework and blames it on the students. She made my semester so frustrating.I do not know what my grade for her class is, because as usual, she is late in grading assignments. There is not enough space here to list how I feel about this professor\'s teaching style."

You should stay on top of the reading all semester because if you wait to study the night before a test you will be screwed. Her passing grade is a 70 and her test are long and hard. She is a pretty cool professor overall.

I passed both midterm and finals with B+ and she gave me a C+ for a final grade. She doesn\'t care for her students and doesn\'t care to fail anyone. Pathetice professor don\'t waste your time.

I believe she was known as Professor Pina. I got an 85 on my midterm and she gave me a C+ as a final grade. All she does is speak of her personal life. Please stay away.
