He sometimes tends to drift off topic BUT, when it comes to the nitty gritty he will test you like you\'re suppose to be tested and provides power points, test practice manuals, and homework examples. I truly enjoyed his class."

If you go into his office hours, he\'ll explain things a lot better! Overall though, I wouldn\'t recommend taking him!"

He is very generous with curving grades. However, I had to learn the concepts independently. I did not understand what he was teaching and I recommend tutoring and/or study groups-- that is the only reason why I passed the class with a C+"
