Homework every night and she expects a lot from you, but she grades you on your effort. If she sees you are trying your hardest, you\'ll get a good grade. Do all the reading and participate in class. No test or quizzes, but projects and a lot of writing. She really loves what she does, great class to take!"

The readings are difficult (obviously-it\'s theory), but she explains so well the next day that I understood every concept perfectly! She moves fast, so be willing to be adaptable. Also, if you don\'t understand an assignment, make sure you go to her, because her explanations aren\'t great. A little hung up on Hurston, but overall A+++!!"

She\'s no help and doesn\'t make her assignment\'s clear enough. During class she\'ll never give you any real answers to any of your questions and never lets anyone finish what they have to say during discussions. There is work due EVERY single class. avoid this woman! I HATE her!

I did three papers and worked really hard on them, I am a good writer and an A-student btw, but I was unable to get anything above a \'C\' on any of my essays so I dropped the class before the last day to drop a class. Too much work, hard grader, wouldn\'t recommend."

She expects you to either print out the story or to bring your laptop to read from. She wants you to learn how to close read. Two papers. Midterm paper is a traditional one. The final one is what you are interested. Always available for you. Wants the best for you.

She is very enthusiastic about what she teaches, i.e., trauma theory. Two papers (one midterm & one final). Class participation and attendance matters. Must do 8 out of 12 one-page responses which is fair. May or may not be ""easy"" depending on interest. She is very open and helpful. A good professor but there are better."

We had 13 possible topics to choose from for the final paper, based on our major, which doesn\'t need to be a traditional eng essay. She is a must take for an easy high grade."
