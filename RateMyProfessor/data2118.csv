Samantha  Brooks,Cornell University,Animal Science department, Ithaca, NY,4,2.5,N/A,3.1,,7,10/10/2013,ANSC2650,2.0,4.0,Mandatory,N/A,N/A,A,,0,0,You get to do ten barn chores that take about an hour and fifteen minutes to do. Lectures are necessary. Quizzes cover random facts and not so much the actual useful stuff or even the material focused on. Quizzes are harder than prelims. TA\'s are generally not nice or all that available. Office hours do not exist. Horse experience is necessary!!!

Worth going to class and labs as she will often quiz you on things she said that aren\'t necessarily in the lecture slides. Some bad questions, but mostly straight from lecture. Not required that you have horse experience but definitely helpful."

Tests are multiple choice and usually straight from the lecture materials which are readily available, some tough questions but all the info is right in the notes. Good to get hands on experience with horses. Labs are interesting and hands on (theyve improved)"

Her tests are multiple choice for the most part and test on random numbers and facts rather than concepts. Terrible class."

She is not helpful or friendly, worst class i have taken."

I\'ve been around horses a while but still found much of the class info. valuable. The labs could be boring, but I bet those will get better over time, too. Dr. Brooks\' tests usually had a few tricky questions but overall they were fair if you studied. Highly recommended."

The material we learned was incredibly easy but the test questions were roundabout and had multiple possible answers (she was only looking for one...)If you already know something about horses, don\'t bother. You know more than the class will teach you anyway."
