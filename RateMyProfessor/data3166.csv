Fred  Hall,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Physics & Astronomy department, Chapel Hill, NC,0,2.5,N/A,4.0,,1,02/06/2009,PHYS116,2.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I am not really a physics person but in his class you really have to be. He is a cool guy but he is not a good teacher. I find myself learning the material on my own which is very hard because it\'s physics. You need a good teacher to learn the material and I would not recommend Fred Hall as a teacher
