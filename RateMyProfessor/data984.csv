Good: Take home tests/quizzes and minimal homework. Bad: Never sticks to syllabus, so you really need to be there every week. Plus... he rambles. A lot. It makes for a very frustrating classroom experience."

He explains everything really clearly and is always around if you have questions. He\'s really nice and he\'s lenient about attendance and late assignments; as long as you turn them all in before the end you\'re good. Tests are take home. He cares more about you learning WELL then putting in hours of work for just a grade.
