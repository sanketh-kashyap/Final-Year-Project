I\'m pretty sure I got the only A for our section. Dont get caught up in your opinion about the topics just remember them. Do the readings he gives, take the quizzes right after class and study for the tests. Overall it wasn\'t hard in my opinion"

I never bought either of the books and went to class about once a week and was still able to get a B in the class. The info he posts on blackboard is what saved me. Go to class regularly and keep up with the reading and it\'s an easy A.

I could read the book, go to class, and then read his notes and get it. I wouldn\'t take any other teacher simply because of how good his notes are on blackboard."

Very boring subject and jumbled information. However, he makes great outlines for everything covered and puts them all on blackboard. Reading his assigned material helps a lot but studying his outlines will get you a good grade. Tests are straightforward, just know your stuff. See him during office hours."

Prof is pretty good and is willing to help. Fair grader on tests. Takes attendance and grades on that and participation, so show up for class. You will read a good bit from the 2 books, but it really makes it easier. Makes very good outlines to study from for every subject."
