I TOOK HER CLASS IN A ROOM THAT WAS FILLED WITH COMPUTER. SHE DID NOT CARE IF STUDENTS WERE USING THE COMPUTER OR PAYING ATTENTION TO HER. I DID NOT LEARN ANYTHING FROM HER EVEN THOUGH I GOT AN A, HER TESTS ARE REALLY EASY AND BASICALLY YOU WONT LEARN. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSOR"

NOT HELPFUL AT ALL I IN PARTICULARY DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING BECAUSE EVERY STUDENT WERE MOSTLY IN THE COMPUTER THAN PAYING ATTENTION TO HER. DO NOT TAKE HER, U WONT LEARN ANYTHING."

She has a quirky sense of humor but you get used to it. I found the course pretty easy. All tests are multiple choice and the final is NOT cumulative. One essay paper on a topic of your choice. I would recommend her.
