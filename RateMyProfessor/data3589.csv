I have never thought that I could learn such a great amount of Spanish just for one semester. She was very organized for this Spanish 1 class, always used the textbook (which was helpful for me because I didn\'t know any Spanish at all), and gave us a lot of homework. Great learning experience for me and highly recommended."

Garcia\'s class. Students mentioned she\'s a bit disorganized, and I agree, but find it endearing. Part of her disorganization is because she\'s so relaxed. There were a lot of conversations that I would have been annoyed about if I were in her shoes, but she\'s really cool about it. She teaches well. She deserves a higher rating."

She was very unhelpful and downright rude for the most part. She was very unclear in what she wanted and expected. Test review was moments prior to the test which was useless.

Doesn\'t collect or grade homework. Reviews new material an hour before the the test, and then that appears on the test. Doesn\'t give back final test because she reuses.
