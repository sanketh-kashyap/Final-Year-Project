You have to pay attention to the lectures themselves because you\'ll be lost if you tune out and just write what\'s on the board. Our class was only graded on 4 (easy) tests and one paper, so the workload was manageable throughout the semester. I have no reason not to recommend his class."

His lecturing is always so in-depth that you dont need to actually read anything to pass which is nice when the workload gets heavier throughout the semester. He makes an 8am enjoyable. Tests are super easy. 5 questions each and the final takes questions from previous tests

There\'s a lot of reading and sometimes he makes everyone read from the text aloud. He\'s knowledgeable and even gets some authors to come and read for the class.
