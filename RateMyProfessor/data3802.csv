I still laugh when I think about my intro to CJ class...he was talking about how Pepsi was overtaking campus and how one day he was going to have to say ""this class is brought to you by Pepsi."" AAAnyways...very easy to understand, decent book, manageable amounts of homework. Easy enough tests. Loved it!"
