He is an old guy, with very conventional in his teachings. The key word is precision. You have to do everything he says to the bone. Important to be open-minded with the class, as he will come of as abrasive when you make a mistake. He\'s willing to help, but you have to make the effort. Makes it easier"

Dr. Weinig is very rude, abrupt, and disrespectful. He is by far the worst teacher I have ever had in my college career which several other students also have the same views by reading these comments. He gives confusing and changing directions. Had to report him to president of university for misconduct in his emails."

I started off doing really bad because I did not care much for this class since it was online. He makes you read this book by Eli Goldratt and you\'ll see that he really wants to be the character named Jonah.

Why AMS 441 is given as an AMS course I will never know. It seems like no BUS students wanted to take his course so this course was thrown into AMS. He is incredibly disrespectful. If you want to kiss ass and learn NOTHING about your major then take him. A disgrace to Stony Brook.

EVER. Ridiculous comments and insults in repsonse to homework assignments. Contradictory information on his assignmnets and syllabus which was never clarified. Will never take him again.

It is solely a business course. Weinig is the worst professor I have had. He insults students if they can?t answer his questions. His ?current? business examples are from 1990. He doesn?t want to be bothered with the students. The TA grades all the papers every week.
