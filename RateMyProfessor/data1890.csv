If you want to be empowered to do something or speak publicly, then take his class."

He is always there when you need help, and makes coming to class fun with group activities, discussions, and his personal stories. I gained a lot of valuable, real-life skills from his class."

Otherwise, you should take someone elses course and undervalue yourself. If you want to step up to the plate, take Erik\'s class."

He is willing to work with students and provide additional feedback. The great thing about Erik is he is willing to improve his teaching skills by asking students for feedback about his classes. If you study and complete the required speeches you should do great. I did and I was scared (still am) of public speaking.
