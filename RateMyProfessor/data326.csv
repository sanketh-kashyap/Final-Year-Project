Tests are very straight forward from ppt slides--but not easy. You must study. Grades very fair and quickly. Lab exams are much easier than lecture. I hear horror stories of other A&P professors. Dr. T is great! Highly recommend!"

Helpful study guides and practice tests. Fastest grader ever. Cons: Abrasive personality, rolls her eyes at you, talks negatively about students who don\'t understand concepts. Seems like she really does not want to be teaching and would rather be running because she ""is a runner""...which you will hear 1000 times."

Her expectations are very clear. Do the assigned labs, study the ppt slides, study guides, and practice tests--you will do well. She is very knowledgeable and helpful if you need assistance. She makes the extensive amount of material manageable and easy to understand."

She was completely thorough in presenting the subject matter and I feel prepared to move on to nursing school. She was very helpful in preparing the for the exams - this is not to say that her exams were easy though -you definitely have to know the material.
