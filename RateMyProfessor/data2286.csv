YOU WON\'T PASS.  ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS  HILARIOUS,0,0,"Schweitzer gets through a lot of material quickly, so you need to put in your part of the effort. If you read the textbook before coming to class, his lectures make everything click in. Otherwise, he always posts detailed lecture notes so you can go over anything you missed, and failing that, attend his office hours. Very subtle but witty humor!"

If you\'re unsure with something, even if it is something small, GO TO HIS OFFICE HOUR! The only reason how I managed to get through this class is attending his office hours. He is willing to help and clarifies until you understand."

He\'s an ok lecturer, but doesn\'t emphasize well what is going to be covered on exams. However, if you review and understand the problems in BOTH his notes and the homework, you should do well. Theres no textbook, leaving only the problems from lecture and the homework to study."

YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,No textbook was given for this class but I kinda wish there was for those times when the lecture material was confusing. There are not many examples in class which makes in harder and everything is mostly theoretical and not numerical. He dropped our lowest midterm grade and only counted 45 problems on the final. Teaches well if you stay focused.

It can be boring at times, other times invaluable."

His exams are like from his homework and his homework is not that bad. He does not teach that well, so need to self teach. But he is a very nice professor and would any problem difficulty that you have if you talk to him one to one."

He has a slight accent. Homework can be tough at times. Study his lecture notes and you should be fine for the exams, which are quite fair in my opinion. He drops the lowest homework and exam (not including the final)."

That said, Schweitzer is very math-oriented. I would only recommend him to someone who has at least completed CALC II (1132Q)."
