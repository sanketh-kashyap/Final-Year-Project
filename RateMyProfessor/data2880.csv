Pam  Laufer-Ukeles,University of Dayton,Law department, Dayton, OH,5,1.5,N/A,3.6,,13,07/02/2014,LAW6107TORTSI,4.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Some others hated her. I loved her. She skipped the BS and often would bypass students question in order to cover all the material. There was no surprise on the final and she would answer any question you had after class. She kept pace with the material which is important for the final and later the bar. Somewhat disheveled but informative.

Highly disorganized, with notes and in class. Notes are not left up with important information and told just get them online and they are not online. Hard to follow when the most common phrase is \'that\'s not what I meant to say\' is done multiple times a class. Asks ?s on exams that can\'t be determined with information given in class"

Constantly acted as if every conclusion was easy to come to when students were struggling. Relied heavily on online learning because she did not attend class for personal reasons. Not effective. Did her students a disservice.

Her slides, EXAMS, and emails are inundated with grammar and spelling errors. Does not treat students with proper respect. No, we aren\'t Harvard students, but we deserve some element of professionalism."

She was often disorganized. She could be short and rude with students. She struggles understanding how things work even when a case is pretty clear how things work.

Yet, she is very disorganized about using them. If you ask a question & the answer is not in her notes you\'ll throw her off. She is not clear in her communication, then easily gets frustrated when students don\'t understand the subject matter like she thinks they should. Open book 2 hypo essay test."

If this is an example of what the best law school in the nation has to offer then we are doomed."

She came to class always with an attitude and would make snippy comments. Very disorganized and scattered. Not a friendly professor at all.
