Mike  Lepp,Columbus State Community College,Paralegal department, Columbus, OH,1,2.5,N/A,3.3,,6,09/22/2010,LEGL264,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Very confusing. Didn\'t learn ANYTHING in this class. He talks a mile a minute and expects you to catch on. He makes you write down what he says or writes on the board and expects you turn it in word for word for case studies. If you don\'t want to learn anything and are a speed writer this is the class for you. I do not recommend him to anyone.

The sole purpose was to write down what he said and then turn it in as a ""case study.""This class was nothing more than bean counting. Worst class I have had at CSCC."
