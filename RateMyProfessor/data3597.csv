Fortunately, he has gotten better(most likely due to all of the negative reviews students give him). He tries his best to relate and be thorough but just doesn\'t get there sometimes. in quant his tests were completely different than work in class. 4200 is more related to classwork"

His accent does make understanding him a small obstacle in the beginning, but absolutely do-able if you care enough to try. His tests are quite a bit harder than ANY material presented in class, but he does give partial credit."

Dropped my grade to a B+ even though I was 15 points above the average. Very hard to understand and his test questions are identical to his practice ones.....only 20x harder

If you ask him a question is response is ""UH, OK"",as if he did not understand stand what you said. He is terrible and has no business teaching. It is a shame we pay for this class. Do not take him!!! Your better of teaching yourself!"

Or just don\'t even bother coming to class, lol. Everything I learned, I taught myself from the book - his lectures are completely useless. There is a MAJOR accent barrier, & he talks too fast anyway. Exams are fair, though - they often come straight from assigned homework problems so if you\'re diligent and teach yourself, you\'ll be fine."

Do not take this professor if you are lazy. You will have to rely on the book a lot because he teaches at a pretty fast pace.

Expects you to somehow know all the material. I thought Dr. Wild was bad but this guy is even worse."
