Heather  Price,Highline College,Chemistry department, Des Moines, WA,5,4.1,N/A,3.2,,21,09/01/2014,CHEM163,1.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Do not take chemistry with Heather price. It is one of the most confusing and frustrating experiences ever. I am not sure why the reviews are so good but I believe it is because she is nice and the class is easy so students do not notice that you actually don\'t learn very much.
Heather  Price,Highline College,Chemistry department, Des Moines, WA,5,4.1,N/A,3.2,,21,05/20/2013,CHEMISTRY163,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,1,"Dr. Price loves Chemistry and it really shows! Especially when she goes on about pollution. It\'s really interesting to watch. The pre-lab and post-lab work became tedious after three quarters but you get use to it. If I was to take chemistry, I would definitely take it with her. Dr. Price wants people to succeed. That\'s the difference."

Dr. Price will prepare you very well for the general chem series. Giving out alot of handouts that are very helpful.If you go everyday she prepares you very well before every exam.

Chemistry is difficult enough as it is and she makes it harder. The hw takes you hours and is worth like nothing! You need to work very hard in her class. I have to learn basically everything from the book.

She was very approachable and really cared whether you understood it or not. I would take a class from her again if I could.

Made the class very interesting, labs were also fun. I like her as a teacher, but the course content was difficult. Lots of calculations, which you should definitely expect on the exams."

Treats the workload as if she is the only class. If you work full time, forget it. Gives a list of curriculum rather than making an actual test review. Posts material late online. She may not be aware she is teaching adults rather than children."

ONE DAY TO LEARN NEW MATERIAL+OLD. RIDICULOUS. HER FAVORITE QUOTE ""THIS SHOULD ALL BE REVIEW""....Right."

She explains her labs thoroughly, and she really enjoys clarifying materials for students. Her tests are pretty easy too. Its very much identical to her old exams that she posts on angel; only the numbers on the test changes."

The only down fall is that her practice exams don\'t follow the exams she give in class. It\'s just more work for you to do. And also her exams are too long. way to long. If you know the material yet don\'t have enough time to finish then too bad for you. Great, but exams are to long."

You will learn chemistry based on her lectures. The only downside to her class is the tests. Dr. Price will test you on pretty much everything from the book. I\'ve taken other chemistry professors at Highline and Dr. Price\'s tests are just as difficult if not more difficult than other professor\'s.

SUPER NICE TEACHER i would take her for the whole series"

But she gives 1 week or 1 1/2 week to do it.There are like 25-30 probs..easy grade doesnt check"

Provided crystal clear explanations of the concepts and consistently had a straightforward schedule for assignment due dates.
