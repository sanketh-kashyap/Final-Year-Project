Sunita  Goel,Siena College,Accounting department, Loudonville, NY,7,3.3,N/A,3.2,,13,04/19/2016,ACCT300,3.5,4.0,N/A,Yes,Yes,A,,0,0,"Goel is an overall great professor! She tries her best to make the material clear and interesting. She is definitely willing to help each student to the best of her ability. Hw is minimal, but I believe it is important to study on your own time in order to keep up with the material. Take Goel!!"

However, the program we use is horrible. Prof Goel really wants you to succeed. She is the best Prof that teaches this class. She often assigns 10 multiple choice questions. It is rather difficult to understand her at times & I often ask her to repeat herself."

She does have an accent but it is not hard to get used to. The class itself is a hard one anyways and she is always willing to help you out if you need it. If you don\'t do well on the tests the group project and extra credit brings your grade up

If you are halfway intelligent and pay attention in class, not much time outside is needed. I\'ve taken almost all accounting professors @ siena and she\'s your best bet for an A."

It is hard to understand what she is even talking about and sometimes it doesn\'t appear she even knows what she is doing when she erases the board 100x and has to correct it... When the class average is failing she tells us we need to work harder and there is no reason everyone can\'t get a 100.

The labs are tough if you dont use the answers on blackboard and the quizzes are easy. Tests require a lot of studying, but who expects to get a good grade in accounting with out studying a lot?"
