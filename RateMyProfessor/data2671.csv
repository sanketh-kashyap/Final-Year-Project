Will take points off if you do not give your opinion on work he wanted research and cited ridiculous. Will not take again."

DO NOT TAKE HIS COURSE! He teaches with a stale and boring approach. Never an encouraging word to say about your assignments, even if you are a straight A-student! Is slow to open tests and assignments, takes forever to grade, not fun to work with."

He\'s not really critical of your writing and grades it fairly easy as long as you do it. However, it takes FOREVER to get your grades. In the class I took his exams were actually writing assignments."

He was a fair but rather hard instructor. He made students work for their grades, which is good!"

Very hands off as an instructor. I had signed up for the same class but under a different professor. When I entered the class for the first time, it was Prof. Tovar. I decided to give it a chance rather than withdraw. I\'m sorry I did."

I had no issues with this instructor. The class is writing intensive and very involved. I would recommend his class for those interested in his style of teaching.

This professor hard tons on typos, gave grades on instructions he did not give you, and compared your work to the other students in the class. Horrible professor in general, plus it took over 2 weeks to get my grads after submitting as assignment."

Chose the professor because of their BIO but disappointed by their constant typos, incomprehensible instructions, and tardiness with grades. Didn\'t learn as much as I would have liked to, put more effort into this class than others and still feel I ended up without proper knowledge."
