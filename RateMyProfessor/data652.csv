She\'s very a very tough prof, but is always available for help outside class and makes a really good effort to make class enjoyable and fun! Her tests and quizzes are always very straightforward and based on the material she gives you."

There is a quiz with a partner every day you have lecture. This forced me to study and really get a grasp on the material. I would take her again in a heartbeat! It was always a joy to go to her class.

Daily reading quizzes were way too much. She wasn\'t clear with her lectures at all. Half the time it seemed like she was unsure of the material while she was lecturing on it. Labs had no relation to lecture material and were too lengthy. Wouldn\'t suggest this professor!!

Refuses to help if you\'re struggling, puts herself on a very high pedestal above everyone else, all around awful experience. Avoid at all cost."

She uses many different teaching styles to solidify the information in the students\' mind, and she occasionally drops a corny joke or two in a lecture. BIO 181 is a tough course, but she does as much as she can to help her students pass and be successful in their careers."

Great at explaining the content and tests are fair (they come right off of her powerpoints). Daily reading quizzes with a partner make attendance mandatory but they aren\'t hard. Sometimes it feels like she is teaching to 5th graders because of her cheezy jokes and hands on projects but she is effective.
