He knows a lot about business and working in corporate America. What most most helpful about this class was that he teaches you how to write a resume and helps you make a plan for reaching your education and career goals. Professor Tryhane\'s class was a welcomed relief from my harder classes.

You have a discussion or two each week as well as 2 HW assignments and two quizzes. Maybe an extra HW assignment as well. So that all took roughly 2-3 hours a week to finish. I think I would have rather taken his on grounds class because he seems like an interesting teacher.
