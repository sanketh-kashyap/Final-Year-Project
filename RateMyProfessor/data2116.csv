She was an awesome professor when I had her and you can tell she\'s willing to bend over backwards to help her students. The class was also really interesting. I\'d take it over again if I could.

I am fairly confident I got the only A in the class, and even on single tests only one or 2 people got A\'s. She makes strides to help her students where they are struggling though, so I feel if others had put in the effort I did an A wouldn\'t be too difficult."

Minimal interaction with the class and she uses powerpoint presentations. You can easily read your book and pass this class.
