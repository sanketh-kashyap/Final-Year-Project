Topics range from bigfoot to aliens to Atlantis, etc. If you\'re looking for something different and outside of the box then I would recommend this course (only draw back is that there is a group project)"

This course was made near impossible due to the inaccessibility of notes and curriculum outcomes. Asking questions doesn\'t resolve confusion if anything it causes frustration, as the materials covered are not consistent with the \'textbook\', notes, lectures, and assignments.

He doesn\'t put lectures on D2L which is fine but he goes through the slides so fast that I\'m focused on writing them down and don\'t pay attention to his further clarification.

Easy questions with options on what one to do and not grade too roughly. Multiple choice and T/F just suck."

He is actually interested in helping you pass and learn the stuff. He speaks clearly and his quiz are fair and the format is easy although you actually have to read the book because some of the questions come out of left field. I really liked him and I will be taking more classes with him and I recommend him to any one
