I dropped the class due to personal problems, but i don\'t believe i would take one of his classes again. if you\'re looking to take a psy class i recommend Kevin Burns if he\'s available."

It is ridiculous to post neg comments on prof after 4 weeks. All lecture outlines are available on pwr pt; he answers all e-mails promptly; he curved 1st test very student friendly. What more do you want? Dr. McDade is composed & considerate. Good class & an even better man

Tests are insane and unfair. Tough material w/o much help. no test review/no study guide/no xtra credit/quiz offered as punishment. Anyone this boring should be more helpful. Went into class loving psych with A\'s in 3 prev Psy classes; He\'s almost succeeded in ruining psy for me.
