DID NOT LEARN MUCH ABOUT AMERICAN CHILDHOOD. Test were fairly easy if you can make it through the MINDLESS discussions. Anything less than a B in this class would be Ridiculous!"

Lacks maturity and professionalism to be a College Professor. Has class prepare one things then decides on something different. Did not learn about ""American Childhood"", but learned some about Folklore."

Missed 2 classes in the first 2 weeks of class. Rude to students and the material in the class was useless. The most irritating class I\'ve ever taken.

She has a degree in folklore, and talked more about that than American Childhood. Easiest tests I have ever taken in my life. Nice lady, but shouldn\'t teach this class."

Capstone with about 180 students and it was like high school all over again, loud and out of control. I went into the final not knowing if I got credit for half of the work I did. Asking and emailing did no good. Got my 4 units and nothing else from the class."

She was not organized at all and it reflected in her class. She took 7 weeks to grade anything and was not sure what would be part of your grade. Never answers e-mails and cannot answer questions. Save your sanity...

Grading took forever and the class overall was okay. The tests are easy if you read all the stories. The project was fine but the presentations took about 3-4 weeks to get done.
