Courtney  Winston,Sam Houston State University,Family & Consumer Science department, Huntsville, TX,0,5.0,N/A,2.0,,1,02/09/2009,FCS141,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Really good professor. She is really helpful and will answer any questions you have. All the test information comes off the powerpoints so if you really study thoes you will do fine. She teaches several classes in the department so I recommend taking her as much as possible.
