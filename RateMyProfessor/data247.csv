Lashea  Davis,Temple University,Social Work department, Philadelphia, PA,6,4.5,N/A,3.7,Respected (1)  Participation matters (1)  Skip class? You won\'t pass.

She always explains things if need be and wants to help students as long as they do the work. Her classes are typically boring because the discussions are long but usually very insightful. I would definitely suggest her to any undergraduate social work majors!

Helpful outside of class if you need assistance.

Grading is fair and she doesn\'t hold you responsible for anything it is she feels was not made clear in class. The only problem I had in this class (Comm in SW practice) was that she would sometimes demand more knowledge of the field itself than a beginning SW student would have."
