One of my best professors of music! I am truly blessed to be her student. She is always willing to help, very patient and kind, and funny. She is not a harsh grader, very understanding professor. She expects some respect and discipline, but that is totally fine for me. If you do your homework, you\'ll be great. RECOMMENDED"

Totally not easy. Maybe at. City college she was but def not here. Yes funny, nice and sarcastic, ETC but she\'s intimidating. HW everyday, midterm and final. It\'s a beginners piano course not a Piano expertise course. Too strict. She could lighten up a bit. ESP since most students take this as an ELECTIVE FOR BASIC REQUIREMENTS."

Not only she is an easy grader and extremely helpful, she makes her lectures very easy to understand. If you study your lectures you will do very well. And also because the final was based on the previous test, I actually was able to really absorb the information. Very good professor!!"

An A+if you study for the tests and there\'s listening sections on the test as well so you have to remember pieces and composers. 2 Concert reports were cake and final had same exact questions taken from 4 previous tests. Attendance is absolutey mand

All you gotta do is take notes what she teaches you in class. you will have to do four tests, 2 concert reports, one presentation, and the final.
