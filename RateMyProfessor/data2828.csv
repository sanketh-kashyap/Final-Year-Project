Rebecca  Faught,Temple University,English department, Philadelphia, PA,0,3.8,N/A,2.0,,2,08/21/2009,ENG0826,4.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,She is definitely still figuring out what methods of teaching work for her students. She expect students to read the textbook when it is assigned. She can be flexible when assignments have to be turned in. The only thing I dislike about her teaching style is that she didn\'t remind students when the reports were due...keep the syllabus handy.
