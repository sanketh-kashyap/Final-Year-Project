She failed to understand that i learn and make art in a different way than she does, but that was an unacceptable excuse to her. she also has a ""just do it"" attitude about making art-if thats your style and you dont mind her ""humour"" and criticism go for it."

She is a smart, strong, interesting, crass, funny, and loving woman who will push you to your best and inspire you with her attitude and energy. She\'s a caring mentor and supportive teacher. Don\'t take her (at times harsh) pushing personally, she does it with love and intelligence- she wants you to think and do."

She seems to be in her own world, I didn\'t understand her sarcasm and to her an A is 100 times better than perfection. She tears you apart in crits, especially if she is hating on you that day. She speaks her mind 100% of the time, and don\'t expect her to learn your name. You will be called ""you"" or ""uh"" DONT TAKE"

You may not see it at first but she will win your heart with low grades and seductive glances. Her projects are cool. Really tough grader. Bad criter. But she makes up for it with her slamin body and beguiling lingo.
