She makes her expectations very clear at the beginning of the semester. Prepare to watch videos of her signing outside of class time to learn the vocabulary, she doesn\'t spend time on it during class. There are 4 exams, 10 fingerspelling/number pop quizzes, 5 expressive presentations, and 1 group presentation. Textbook is unnecessary."

As a group we all became more like family then just a class. There is practically no homework other than to record yourself practicing 15 min a week. Quizzes are super easy. Kathy is a great instructor and is willing to modify her class to suit the needs of others. I highly recommend her.
