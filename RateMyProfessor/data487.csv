You have to complete two concert reports , weekly chapter summaries , a term paper , listening quizzes and midterm and final exams . I was also annoyed that I had to purchase the text book just to write the chapter summaries , we never used it in class."

Dumb. Diponio is a great teacher. He helped me with my writing and transfer applications. He showed me that there is a lot of great music out there. if your one of the people who skips class all the time then you won\'t do well.

He\'s rude & makes cocky comments. I learned more about Mozart & Beethoven in 10mins from someone who isn\'t a teacher, than I did from him all semester!
