Prof Peck is a stand up guy. I highly recommend to those who needs this credit to take with him. Also, do not buy the textbook. We never used it, it was more for your learning. Study the practice questions he gives you every chapter and you\'ll pass. I only got a B for my own personal events getting in way."

The only thing he does not stick to is his syllabus. I took him in my first semester of college. He cancelled the first class and consistently cancelled classes throughout the semester. We did not get through every chapter, and the tests were not on the day they were scheduled originally. Otherwise, GREAT PROF!"

It was the only reason I woke up in the morning. He really got me interested in the psychology field. He sends you the power points and the test reviews for you to study and his test are pretty dead on to the reviews. You definitely should take notes on his lectures (which by the way he keeps interesting). The only downside is your grade depended on the three test you took through out the semester
