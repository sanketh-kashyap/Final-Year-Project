Liu  XU,Babson College,Business department, Babson Park, MA,0,1.0,N/A,4.0,,1,02/03/2009,ASM3300,1.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I wish that clarity of english were a prerequisite for teaching at Babson. Apparently it isn\'t because I have to struggle to understand her. She is nice but incapable of capturing the attention of her students. Her expectations are unreasonable given how far she falls short of our expectations of a teacher at such a prominent business school.
