You can tell he loves what he does and always encourages you to keep up the good work. Be there everyday and show that you\'re trying."

He\'d help you through anything and everything and would always encourage you as an individual. He\'s rather nice but don\'t be fooled, you better work in this class to get an A--do all your homework and come to class as often as you can because a lot of your grade comes from in-class work."
