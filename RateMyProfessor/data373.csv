The first day began with ""for those of you who have not scene calculus before"" ... In the first calculus. He will be hard, you will have to dedicate a lot of time to learn the material as his class will not do it. I do not recommend him at all."

The class was really confusing for those of whose who aren\'t good at math and he expected everybody to know what he was talking about. He was always available to help you with anything after class which was awesome and extremely beneficial."

Then go on to say he is not so bad for doing so? Only a teacher himself would write such a thing. What a shame.

Actually, I think is pretty good and very funny. In my class, he answered everyone\'s questions even if it\'s stupid. But, he does choose favorites, and he helps them outside of class. Overall, a decent and funny teacher."

Expected the students to already know what he was doing without explaining it. Sometimes funny, but that\'s not what\'s important. He gets off topic easily and rarely helps a student when they ask for it one on one in class. He just tells you to look at your book to learn it."

He goes out of his way to find ways to make the concepts make sense. Calc has a HIGH failure rate and he works w/students to learn the material so they succeed. Take his class, you will not regret it. He wants to see students succeed. It\'s night & day from my prev Calc I prof at BCC. I learned soo much bc of his teaching style!"

Instead of explain math problem he just writing a English. I think he can be a good English teacher not Math."
