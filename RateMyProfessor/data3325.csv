She really cases about what she is teaching, and wants to make sure everyone doesn\'t memorize, but learn for the future. She also was very helpful and approachable. She also would be open to discussions in class, and making sure everyone understands what is going on. I would love to take her class again!!"

Great teacher had alot of fun in her class. I also learned alot. If you have to take this class take it with her. Better than i expected. Is fair with grading and projects. Health stream is a must to complete the class.

She\'s very clear & makes med term far more interesting than I ever imagined it to be. Altough she doesn\'t count attendance, don\'t miss a class bc you\'ll be far behind. As long as you pay attention, follow her lectures, & read what she tells you to, you will pass without even having to study much. I wish she taught more classes!"

This is all new to me and she didnt teach anything clearly. You can barely understand her because her english isnt that good. And she didnt even put up powerpoints. She didnt even teach all she would do is make us play games the whole class. DONT TAKE HER, BAD TEACHER"

DO HEALTH STREAM and all the assignments, because theres really only a few of them."

It is an easy class but she doesn\'t give good direction or let you know why you get the grades you have...We watched movies most of the time. Ridiculous!

If you want your money well spent, don\'t. I can\'t honestly say I learned anything in her class. She makes you present the same ""presentations"" all semester long. What a waste of a good class!"
