This teacher was out of the country, or out of town, several times during the semester. She claimed to have a quick e-mail turnaround. False. In our last class, she claimed she had sufficiently answered our questions. False. She claimed she was clear. False. Avoid."

Grades are very subjective. Creates assignments that have nothing to do with the reading. Assigned a textbook that was a version too old and then we never used it. Did an assignment that I spent hours searching the internet for and she wasn\'t satisfied but wouldn\'t let us use other sources. Stay away!

LOTS of work, very time consuming, but an easy A if you put in the time. don\'t take it if you have a choice. actually just don\'t go to pace!"

I\'m not going to lie, her exams are a little tricky, but in all fairness she does her statistical analysis and takes out questions she felt were unfair to the students. Love her, she is very professional and intelligent."
