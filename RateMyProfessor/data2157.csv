The class is very easy but mainly lecture based with two exams and two papers to back up the content."

Get ready to have your world views shift during this class because it opens your mind to the subconscious influence in politics. Lectures are interesting but long. There are quizzes but he usually gives notice. Easy extra credit available, but you have to be able to briefly talk in front of the class."

Not sure why I have to know Ancient Greek philosophy for communication. ProfVivian is nice but very dry. He met with me a few times when I had to complain about my TA whonever had time to meet and never gave me any helpful feedback on my papers. I hear you can take it in the fall with a better teacher and smaller class.
