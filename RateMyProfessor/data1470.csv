Had him for the second half of 250, and he was by far my favourite prof. Knows his stuff inside out, and is super great at explaining difficult concepts and untangling messy stuff. Lectures are awesome. Easy to follow, lots of passion and enthusiasm, very engaging, pretty funny to boot!"

Is a genius. Incorporates a lot of world events into his classes. Very interesting. I took 2 courses from him this year, and they were both favourites of mine! He can be pretty funny too. Take a class with Cho if you get a chance!"

Hands out boatloads of supplementary readings but they never seem to appear on tests. Classes are very interesting, but to some degree seem oversimplified. Don\'t bother with the textbook he summarizes everything(just memorize his notes)."

Interesting information taught by a very animated prof. Take his classes if offered, he\'s a tough teacher but generous marker."

He\'s a tough marker but he\'s fair. Show up to class, take good notes, and at least browse the readings (there\'s a lot of them). He teaches no bird courses, so don\'t expect them, but you\'ll learn a lot! Very helpful outside of class and a pretty funny guy."

Readings are unnecessary to pass the course (or even ace the exam), but if you genuinely want to learn about World Politics, the readings provide an excellent base. Memorize his notes."

A little bit of a learning curve to get used to his accent, but after you get used to it, the class becomes a lot more fun. One of the smartest profs I\'ve ever had, he enjoys teaching and does it well. The course is difficult, but interesting nonetheless. One of the great profs at X, would definitely recommend him as a prof"
