She is extremely smart, eventhough she comes off a little ditzy and robotic. But if you actually care about your education and get involved in the discussion, you\'ll learn so much. She\'s beautiful and an all-around great teacher. My favorite English professor yet. She doesn\'t try to make it difficult, she just wants you to understand. :)"

I worked hard all semester. Then she gives me a B for a class I never got anything lower than a B+. It was just was waste of time and money. I learned nothing and now it gives my GPA a bad start."
