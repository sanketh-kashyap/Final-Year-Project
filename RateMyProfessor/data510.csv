Jill  Winner,New York University- School of Social Work,Social Work department, New York, NY,4,3.0,N/A,2.8,,11,05/10/2013,CPC2002,4.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I took this professor a few years ago for HB and then again for a Practice class. I liked her both times. The Practice class was more fun and there was more time for case discussion. I would recommend her.

I didn\'t think she read her notes at all. I thought the class - Clinical Practice with Children was great. She allowed for some good discussion.

As stated, all she does is read of a list of notes. I am totally unprepared for HB2, whatever you do, do not take this professor. I wish someone had let me know how awful this would be. She may be okay for an undergrad class, but not here!!!"

She reads her notes instead of teaching, she doesn\'t add anything to the readings, her midterm and final are completely unclear and your grade suffers because of it. She also doesn\'t seem to know anything more than the average masters student, I have no idea how she got this job."

Very dry presentation. You can get the same info from just reading."
