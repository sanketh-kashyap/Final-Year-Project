She really did a good job of making a three hour class seem like less than three hours. She is pretty helpful if you need but also a little forgetful so stay after her if you really need something. Fantastic class and fantastic teacher with a great personality.

She\'s really easy going as long as you do what you are supposed to. There isn\'t a whole lot of work so if you don\'t do an assignment, it will really hurt your grade. She is such a fun teacher and always looks for ways to help you. She doesn\'t accept any late work at all."

In only the second class period I left about 4 five-point assignments in my dorm, so they were all 0s! I ended up getting an A, but it took some effort. She is super funny, super nice and a great teacher. If you don\'t have any late work, you should be fine. You\'re awesome Sister Nelson!!"

I wish she taught FDENG201. I thought I would die in a three hour class, but she makes it interesting. She helps you every step of the way. She\'s tough with work though. No late work, but she gives you so much time to do the work. So get it done."

I took her class last winter and loved having the three hour block. She really allows the classroom to have a comfortable setting and yet she sets guidelines to help us work hard and understand what is expected. She is by far my favorite professor and I would recommend her class to anyone! Great learning opportunity.

She is very helpful and will work with you whenever you need it. She is able to teach at the level you need. I would recommend anybody for this class. She does have rules for her class but that is expected. An easy way to learn about English in a fun way as well!

As far as teaching, she\'s great and understands the best way to teach is when the whole class participates in the conversation. She enjoys humor/sarcasm, just don\'t make it excessive. Grading is equal on both sides. She can tell if you put effort into your writing or not."

She makes sure you know what to do for writing assignments and wants you to be a better writer! You don\'t get second chances for assignments though.

She really cares about what she is teaching and also the people that she teaches. She is willing to meet out of class to help students and these meetings are extremely helpful. She is really a fun person to be around and her class is on of the highlights of my semester.
