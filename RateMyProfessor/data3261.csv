He is always willing to help you if you have questions. He teaches the history of all the relations that are used in the course, and derives them from fundamental equations. This is rare in an age where most instructors just read off of slides. His exams are challenging, so attempt all the homework. One of FIT\'s best!"

I think he is the only one to teach it there"
