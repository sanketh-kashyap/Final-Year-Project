(1),5,03/29/2015,SPAN101,2.5,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,PARTICIPATION MATTERS  SKIP CLASS? YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,Professora Houchens is an extremely kind teacher. She is older and doesn\'t like technology so no moodle. She is very helpful and is understanding when you have to turn in late works. Sometimes she couldn\'t keep the class in order and the students didn\'t seem to respect her like they should have. She would not have been my 1st choice for SPAN 101.

When I went to 102, those that had been in my class with Clay felt confused and were behind those in other classes. Clay was very nice, but way too easy. You learn enough though to get you into 102 and then catch up from there."

But if you come to her for help, she will work with you."
