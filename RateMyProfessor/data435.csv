He is a research nut which shows in his passion for teaching this class. The lectures are long as it the class meets once per week but makes them interesting as long as you participate. Submit a draft for the research paper, the feedback is vital in getting an A."

He expects a lot from you. There are 3 pop quizzes on readings. Make sure you become prepared. There are 3 projects all of which aren\'t bad. He\'s a fair grader. The midterm and final are not bad either. It\'s a mixture of multiple choice, true and false, and short essays."
