Material in book is rarely used on hw or on the exams. Exams are graded harshly.

Whendee doesn\'t use powerpoint so if you miss her lecture you\'re somewhat out of luck. Compared to Dennis, she\'s terse but she\'s not scary or anything like that. He\'s just more relatable. When she\'s not the one giving lecture, she\'ll show up but often leave as soon as possible"
