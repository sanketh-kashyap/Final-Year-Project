I didn\'t understand who I was or where I belong. I felt like nobody cared. In hopes of discovering my true self, I signed up for French, where I thought I would find a new language. Instead, I found Ghada. She saved me. Thank you."

It isn\'t too difficult if you have taken french before. There are 5 chapter quizzes, a midterm, a final and 2 papers (one in english and one in french). This class requires effort. I recommend attending her lab hours for help. She offers many EC opportunities that can easily bring you up a whole letter grade."

It is unfortunate that she only teaches French 101 (as of 2014), but she is still nonetheless engaging, insightful, and passionate. Make sure to do all your work, including the required lab hours, and you\'ll do fine. A very friendly and welcoming individual. Don\'t be afraid to ask question (email or in-person)."

She\'s very helpful, and is willing to answer anything you need help with. She\'s always smiling, so it\'s hard to feel bored. Although she only teaches French 101 (as of Spring 2011), I recommend her. If you attend class every day, you don\'t have to take the final (which honestly isn\'t hard). Pay attention, ask questions, attend class."

Ghada Mouwad is a very good teacher. Yes, she does go a little fast, but she is very clear and understandable. Her beginning class is NOWHERE near advanced. Her assignments are fair and from the workbook. Attend everyday and you won\'t have to take the final. I earned a B+. Easy!"

WOULD NOT RECCOMEND IT, IF YOU ARE NOT FLUENT IN FRENCH."
