She is easy to talk too. Very funny makes learning fun and very down to earth really tries to show her ability to teach instead of showing you how smart she is. I cannot say enough great things about her.

Attendance absolutely mandatory. No cold calling. Very clear and fair. Very funny and engaging, not a class you dread going to. Grading is all related to legal memorandums. Assignments take a lot of time, but Herrera does not hide the ball. If you were assigned her class you essentially hit the jackpot."
