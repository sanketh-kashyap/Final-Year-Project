Did great the first half, horrible the second. Stats is hard and the book she used did not tell you how to do anything. I ended up having to see the examples of the problems and how to solve them before i actually completed them. Also I live over 6000 miles away and had to find a proctor to administer the test. HUGE Pain!"

The book she uses, (hich she helped make)looks more helpful than it actaully is. Seems like it should have to be of better quality. I have always loved math and have never gotten anything less than an A in a math course, but not this one! Directions were VERY disorganized"

Not that easy when you live 1.5 hours away. She had also allowed us to rescudule exams, except she wouldn\'t let me on the final. Strange seeing as how there was an announcement right on blackboard saying that we could rescedule exams."

The class started off a little rocky, because the publishers put the wrong code in the book. Very understandng and responds quickly. I highly recommend."
