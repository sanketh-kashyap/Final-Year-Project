Sits down and helps students who don\'t understand a certain method of photography or skill in Photoshop/Lightroom. As long as you stay on top of your projects, this class is amazing."

Only photo projects, not tests or quizzes. He really appreciates and recognizes those who put in the effort and time. Super knowledgeable. One analysis paper at end of quarter. Don\'t buy all the amounts of supplies on syllabus, buy it as you go. Overall, easy class but don\'t disrespect and not care."

He is passionate about his work and is willing to help. His lectures are fairly long but his power points are interesting. He isn\'t a tough grader he just likes completed assignments. I took the class with no background in photography and i am doing perfectly fine. Fun class. Definitely recommended.

You could walk in halfway through lectures and not miss anything. Assignments are usually short and easy. I never took a single test, but there\'s a final paper. He\'s not good about explaining the basics. You\'ll probably need some previous knowledge of cameras before you take this class."

Horrible at explaining the basics in anything. I think the only positive is that he doesn\'t mind pushing back work. Analysis papers are useless. Only recommend if you are an expert in photoshop, I\'m still confused about it."

He waste a lot of class time setting up things (like still-life). When you ask a particular question he does not explain with clarity. He also does not hold you accountable for things like attendance, which makes it easier to be lazy. I will not take a class with him again."

But I wouldn\'t take his intro class unless you have taken photo in high school pr something because he is not good at explaining the basics. It was fun and most of the time I didn\'t go to class and just did the work in the photo lab whenever I had time. I got an A :)

Be prepared to hand in a project/assignment on a weekly or sometimes biweekly basis. There is too much assigned for an introductory art class: 1 paper, 1 final, 4 projects (with parts a & b), and tons of additional assignments."
