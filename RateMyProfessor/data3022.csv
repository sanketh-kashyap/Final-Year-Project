Donald  Studebaker,Northeastern State University,Music department, Tahlequah, OK,7,4.2,N/A,3.6,Tough Grader (1)  Skip class? You won\'t pass. (1),7,04/05/2016,MUS2863,3.0,4.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,N/A,B,SKIP CLASS? YOU WON\'T PASS.  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,I hated this class. There\'s not really any homework. Just outlines & exams. He does listening exams that are kinda hard. You have to learn the names of foreign songs and where they\'re from. Hard to learn the names. The outlines are long papers you have to type up. Instrument ID\'s and cultural questions. Not a fun class. And an essay.

Each unit has an outline that MUST be done. The tests are all LISTENING EXAMS. You have to memorize the songs and the countries for the tests. There is a day where you get to play the instruments, and it is fun!"

He should be somewhere better than this school, but no one wants to pay him (or can afford) what he is truly worth. If you have the privilege to take one of his classes, be a sponge and soak up as much as you can; he will teach not only the subject, but about life. Highly recommend!!"

If you want to LEARN, there are few finer examples of professionalism and subject knowledge. He is an absolute beast who should be at a more prestigious university, but no one else can afford him.
