She\'s a decent professor but not an authentic individual. She\'ll maintain a high class average so she gets good evaluations and then she screws everyone on the final. Basically makes the final exam much harder than the midterm. By then there is very little recourse though (I think she likes it that way."

If you pay attention in class then you will have no problem.

She is perfect for an intro class - she makes everything crystal clear, gives great examples (which you will then see on the tests) and despite the large amount of work she assigns, all of it has a point and is extremely helpful when studying/preparing for tests. Highly recommend."

Her presentations are well-prepared and well-organized, and she tries to relate the material to life in the Burg, which is cool. Very nice, available for help, and crystal clear. I highly recommend!"

Overall though, she is very helpful and the class is pretty easy. I went in knowing almost nothing about microecon and now it\'s pretty interesting to me. She gives weekly online AND written in-class HW problem sets, two manageable midterms, and a final."

For Econ. of Public Sector, she was a bit boring, but really tried to engage us. She posted powerpoints, and the exams were pretty easy if you went to class consistently. So so helpful outside of class, and genuinely interesting to talk to, as well. Take her!"

She doesn\'t post power points and she goes slow. 3-5 slides a class. She is new, and the spring is her first really year teaching an intro class. She\'s a nice lady though. Online and Written Problem Sets. Two Tests and a Final."

Very helpful and explains things really well, to the point where it\'s boring and a little monotonous. She doesn\'t post powerpoints, so make sure you go to class, but bring something to do while you\'re there. Take her, she\'s really good at teaching Microecon."
