He really took his time, he would show every step he took to get his answer. I never really enjoyed math until I had him as my professor. If you get him do not take advantage of the opportunity and really focus and pay attention in his class."

Wish I could get him again for MTH 030. He was extremely clear and didn\'t skip over anything. He\'s serious when it comes to learning the material, but he knows how to lighten the mood so you\'re not stressed out over it. Consider yourself LUCKY if you ever get him!"

I found his instruction clear and informative, he doesnt waste time, and he keeps the pace moving along. If someone is stuck, he stops and makes sure they get it before he moves on. He always had numerous ways of explaining a topic, if one way didnt click with a student. And he never got ""mad"", as another reviewer said!"
