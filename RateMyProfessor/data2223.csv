I can\'t emphasize that enough. If you do not enjoy going to classes just read the full textbook and feel your life drag out of your body with the anything but fascinating text you are TRYING TO MEMORIZE. I really just didn\'t enjoy this course or his method of teaching at all.

On the other hand, the only thing I found interesting about this class were his stories but as for the material it just wouldn\'t get through to me-his notes or the textbook. Oh and I tried hard! but just couldn\'t manage. Psych was not for me but who knows it might have been the professor."

Funny guy and very interesting. He teaches of slides so learn how to write fast. You have to read the text to do well in his class. For someone barely scraping by with 60% on his tests I managed a B- without looking at the textbook. He cares about his students and responds to emails fast.

Give yourself at least 2 nights to do this before midterms and at least 3 before the final. He gives practice questions which end up on the test. Chris likes to illustrate concepts using stories from his own life, which is interesting to a certain point. Go to class. Unhelpful slides but useful lecture material."

There were interesting parts to the lectures, but very little of it was tested. The textbook was the most important and helpful tool in the class. He talks about himself a lot, and spends a lot of time telling stories which waste time. He also showed up late almost everyday."

However, you DO have to read the textbook and you DO have to memorize a lot. Some of my friends didn\'t go to class, but I think it really helps. Just make sure to read every page of the textbook he assigns or else you will NOT do good b/c the class is not curved. Easy A if you put in the effort"

Unfortunately his tests are much more difficult than anything he talks about in class; which makes the ease of his lectures misleading. If you don\'t mind relying solely on the textbook to get a good mark in this class (with a funny prof on the side) then this class is for you.

Spends too much time talking about himself and telling stories, not enough time going over material. Too much of exam material was not covered in class. Ran out of time to finish the course material. Memorize the textbook to pass."

Got involved with his students and put a lot of effort into his lectures. Wanted you to get more than just course material. Seemed passionate, was humorous, made it personal and relateable. Made lectures based on the experiences of our classmates with things like depression, which they sent him via email. Very cool."

Likes to talk about his personal life a lot, but it\'s always very interesting. His tests are straight forward, but you do have to read the textbook because he doesn\'t cover everything in class. If there\'s going to be something on the exam from his lectures he lets you know, which is awesome!"

However, his exams are extremely tough which he thinks is cause we\'re ""first years"". Plus class is not curved so youre stuck with these lower marks. Also, tests on stuff in the textbook that he doesnt cover in class. Must attend class cause he tests on what he says as well."

Likes to talk about himself. Very abstract thinking (hard to study for exams). Takes some tedious details from text book but also brings in his abstract train of thought from lectures. Going to class and reading text is must.

Attending class is a must since he tests on lecture content (~10-15%) not found in the textbook. Memorize the textbook and you\'ll be fine. Paper was a killer though. BEWARE!!! :o
