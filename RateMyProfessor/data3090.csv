First exam easiest thing in the world, final exam blew every single person out of the water, and the lack of a proper study guide made it that much harder. The lectures are extremely redundant and he just goes around in circles, I may have learned one or two concepts this whole semester! Just annoying"

For a student like myself who likes structure and guidance, his is incredibly frustrating. I also feel that he does not teach skills that will be helpful in getting a job after college. His classes are structured around confusinggroup projects."

His grading system is awful.
