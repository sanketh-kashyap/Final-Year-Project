Being a 100 level I thought it wouldn\'t be as hard, but it is. Her notes barely help with the quizzes and tests."

Shes funny and very helpful if you don\'t understand something. Attendance isn\'t mandatory but her lectures are pretty much the answers to the questions about to be on the quizzes and exams. Everything is online too. I would definitely recommend her!

Attendance is mandatory. I attended every single class and took notes, but her notes are very vague. I ended up searching for test answers on Google all semester. 15 quizzes total and 5 exams, all taken online."

Exams are all online and for hour class we had 15 quizzes that were online and the worst 5 get dropped. Nice class, even though you don\'t have to go. But if you do go you will do better on the exams and quizzes."

I am telling you now, Take the class with her. You don?t have to show up for class, and the quizzes and test are online, so it is easier for you to cheat lol. She is really nice and pretty. The only thing that was tricky is that the test and quizzes sometimes, but beside that, good class."

She is easy to talk to and she don\'t mind helping students out. I hated biology with a passion but she made it fun and interesting. She give quizes take home quizes. On top of being very educated she is also smoking hot. Attendance is not mandatory but I came everyday because she is so beatiful and I wanted to learn more
