At times he is a little difficult to understand because of his accent but he gives out really thorough lecture notes and posts them online. Very helpful in office hours and a really nice grader

He lets you decide how many cheat sheets to have for each exam. Top 1/3 of the class gets an A. Definitely the best stats professor I\'ve had, though that\'s not saying a lot."

He tried very hard to explain everything and always ask us whether we understand him or not. He managed to make the somewhat dry materials more interesting! I like him a lot. By far my favorite professor this semester!

His first exam was really hard and the other ones were pretty easy, so very inconsistent with what kind of problems are on the exams. Lets you use at least couple pages of cheat sheets, 12 for the final so basically can put the entire book on there. His notes are useless and make no sense. TAs are bad."

When midterms are hard they are graded insanely easy. We got 12, yes twelve, cheat sheets for our final exam. this is intro to mathematical statistics. 12 cheat sheets for hypothesis testing and point estimates. he\'s pretty funny too and that helps make lectures bearable"
