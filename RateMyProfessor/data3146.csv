Some don\'t think so, but if you know your history, barely any studying involved. I guess I enjoyed it but after taking AP US history and civics in high school, this class was a breeze. Don\'t stress too much about this one."

Although the class was not easy,..you had to work,...she made it very easy to pass. This was my second OL class. She was VERY responsive and would usually answer questions within 24hours or less. She made the class fun and was very interactive. This was not a class I looked forward to taking but she made it fun!!!!"
