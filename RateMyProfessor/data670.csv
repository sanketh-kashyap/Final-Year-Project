His tests are the hardest things ever. He is an amazing teacher himself who is willing to help in anyway possible. He expects you to watch recorded lectures and take notes outside of class. Homework is somewhat optional and that isn\'t a good thing in a class like this. If you need structure and rules don\'t take w/ Rhoad

He uses the clicker system well where if most of the students don\'t understand he opens it up to discussion and let\'s us redo the question. He also gives random pop quizzes. He told us it is a 50/50 chance of having a quiz every day in class, so attendance is necessary. he\'s Amazing! absolutely should take for CHEM 101!!!!!"

I wouldn\'t recommend taken this class with a full semester of credit hours. The professor is very helpful - posts anything the students want on Moodle (recorded lectures, old tests, etc). Requires a lot of memorization, and you will need to remember all the reactions taught in Org I. The accompanying lab is very entertaining."

The amount of time spent studying outside of class was greater than my in class 16 credit hour semester. This being said, STUDY, and you should do ok. Dr. Rhoad was hard, but honestly the most helpful professor I have ever came in contact with at MWSU."

Very approachable, even outside of office hours. Always willing to explain things if you just can\'t understand something. Relates to the students well. No condescension, always respectful and friendly."
