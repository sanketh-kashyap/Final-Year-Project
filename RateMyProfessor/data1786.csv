Materials is fairly challenging! Most students at UCR are of his taste. Dr. Dearricott is seeking a more intellectual bunch and hence why he decided to visit UCLA.

Basically your grade is composed of the midterm and final, which are both curved. \'B\' grade is achievable but an \'a\' is near impossible. avoid if possible.."

Engages students in a true study of mathematics with theory and practical applications. I enjoyed the course, but be prepared for heavy hw."

I am glad I chose to take him last quarter rather than wait another quarter for another professor"

It was a miracle. Bottom line, try to stay away from this teacher. You could definitely get a better teacher."

It started off rough with alot of proofs, but just go to office hours and he helps alot. The key is come prepared to lecture and everything will make sense and you will learn alot. I recommend him as a professor he really challenges you as a student. I feel like I have the material mastered from his course."

This man is by far the worst professor I have ever had at UCR. His lectures are a joke. He just rambles on and uses the same examples for everything, and the examples he uses aren\'t even that understandable. Get this someone asked him a question and he said, and I quote ""if you don\'t get it, you don\'t get it."" DON\'T TAKE HIM!!"

His lectures are very confusing because he teaches calculus in theory and only really demonstrates proofs. There is a massive curve however and its possible to get a good grade if you invest the time into studying.

However, if one invested enough time into this class it is not hard to earn a descent grade. Professor Dearricott is helpful during office hour. I would recommend this class to anyone who truly wants to learn calculus."

I\'ve taken 8 AP classes in High school and they were like merry-go-rounds rides compared to this. The Final is SICK curved however, so there\'s still a chance that you can do well(ok, average, meh) in the class. Just don\'t expect to be able to retain your sanity. Prof wasn\'t as bad though...decent"
