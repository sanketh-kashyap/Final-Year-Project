He is a tough grader. He does have a sense of humor. Very bad at explaining assignments and what he wants. When student\'s asked for help he just told them their papers were wrong. The whole class was questioning if they were even passing.

But I enjoyed his class very much. He made me challenge myself to become a better writer. He taught me how to read literature and how to analyze. I am glad I had him. I got an A but I worked for it."

I actually enjoyed it! Just follow directions, ask question, show your\'e interested, and you\'ll be fine. At first I was hesitant to take this professor because of the bad reviews. However, I was pleasantly surprised!! Not too many tests. I think the work he gives and the way he grades is fair. Take him!"

He\'s helpful and tries his best to help you out. The only thing I didn\'t like was that he expected you to write about something new cause he\'s tired of reading the same stuff over and over. He\'s there when you need him. He doesn\'t want any late work. He makes you work a lot.
