His passion for biology is refreshing. If you can hold a conversation with him, he will be your favorite teacher."

I had him as a PEN class and he told us before the first test that he would find things in the book that we didnt highlight to test us on and he did just that, made a 68.7 and took Marc Renwick the next semester and came out with an A! I emailed him many times for help and he would always tell me to look in the book."

If you study and do what he suggest you will do well in his class. Don\'t be afraid to ask for help, he will give it. Those who sought his help did better in the class."

But as long as time is put into studying the text book, its not too bad. don\'t be afraid to approach him for help; he really does try to do what he can."

He seems to have no compassion for his students and does not review test! You would think that if only 2-3 people out of your class were passing your test you would try and figure out why? He doesn\'t even acknowledge the situation. He is very corny also! don\'t take his class.

Almost most my whole class has dropped. I found after test 2 it wasnt so bad you just had to get used to his teaching. I can say one thing he has some real annoying words that he use all the time. For the most part you did have to really study the all the chapters. I think the class that was left PASSED

However, students who bash him do not dedicate themselves to the material. Stacy will only dedicate as much effort as you put in. So those who are lazy would not appreciate his style. Good luck!"

Mr. Turner is the worst experience I have ever had in the education sector. He does not teach you anything. He reads from PowerPoint presentations and expects you to read everything in the book. He is IMPOSSIBLE. Just about everyone has dropped. Do not take him--waste of time and money"
