I had her for benefits every wed for the 1st 7 weeks from 6-9. The timeframe sucked, but she made it worth going to. Very effective teacher, doesn\'t tell you when quizzes are, but lets you know what you should know for them. She\'s so awesome that she let me complete a part of an exam I had forgotten to do after class."
