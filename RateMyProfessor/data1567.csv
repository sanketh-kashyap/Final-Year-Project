Very caring. Some cons: 1) it is possible that she will not give feedback 2) maybe strict at times (I like it though). Apart from that be ready to do a lot of work on her class.

She can grab attention of her students very easily and keep the environment busy so students do not get bored. The only \'bad\' history I remember is that I did not get any feedback on my essays except for the first one, so I was not able to work on my mistakes."

She is a fantastic professor and a total professional. You will learn a ton in any of her courses, but be prepared to do the work.. a lot of work. However, she was always there when I needed help."

Dr Betz is extremely knowledgeable about all things language. She has a passion for her job and is willing to go above and beyond for her students - as long as you put in the effort. Challenging class but totally worth it.

She\'s challenging, but very helpful and knowledgeable in subject matter. Works with students to achieve their specific educational goals. If you\'re just needing a class for credit and not that interested in the language, try to find a different section."
