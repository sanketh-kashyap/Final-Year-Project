He gives amazing feedback & will allow you to resubmit assignments when you make changes that he recommends in feedback. His job is not to grade you but to teach you, so that you actually learn something. He is an amazing professor who will help you, guide you, be your friend, and get you to that ""A"""

He is easy to talk to and just a cool guy! He gave so much feedback on the research paper that I was so surprised at his dedication. Most teachers don\'t give as much feedback as he did, & it was so helpful! Probably the best professor I\'ve had. He\'s smart, accessible and interesting. TAKE HIM!!!!"

He\'s a fairly lenient grader. The hardest part was finding people to interview (3 people) in your find of study. The whole essay is 25 pages, double-spaced, and you have to transcribe the interviews. No class time, all online. He was really busy this semester, so he didn\'t send back many ideas for corrections. Fairly easy A."

He returns them with suggestions to incorporate into the final thesis. Very helpful.Interesting too.
