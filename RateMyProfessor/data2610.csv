She glares at anyone who dares to get up in the middle of class to go to the bathroom, yet sometimes wouldn\'t even give an official break during our 3.5 hour class. She\'s also incredibly unorganized and I sometimes doubted her knowledge of the information she taught."

She complains about her students all the time! She has a limited public speaking background. Students in this class are treated like they are in high school. She has very little sympathy for the students with anxiety. She takes up class time with complaining instead of teaching. Drop this class!
