He told me I should consider carpentry when I answered something wrong in lab... in front of everyone! His accent is hard to understand & also he didn\'t show up for lecture one day and the next class was a test day."

He loves to teach and does not mind repeating himself and clarifying topics. He teaches old school and uses the board versus a bunch of power points. He is more than willing to meet before class for extra lecture for those who put in effort. He doesn\'t spoon feed students but makes anatomy easier to learn.

He is a fantastic professor. He comes in about an hour befor lecture to answer any question you may have. If you are in one of his lab classes he will permit you to attend his other lab class to get extra lab time. Come to class prepared and work for your grade.

If you have any questions on the material please ask and he will help you. I really enjoyed the clinical reference he would bring to the table- regarding the material or any other interesting fact on healthcare. Please study study study if you want an A.

Accent hard to understand at times, but much more troubling was the misinformation he gave. This is important if planning to apply this knowledge to a future healthcare field. Also he would often make clerical errors when calculating or transposing test scores to computer record."

Some lecture information he taught was also contradictory from the textbook. His contradictory info sometimes was counted right and other times was counted wrong on tests. It was very hard to know what answer the instructor was looking for.

He is an extremely intelligent man and very passionate about what he does. He tells you exactly what to expect from class and tests. He is very blunt, though it seems ""mean"". This class is difficult no matter which teacher you use. So if you do not succeed, it is not the teacher\'s fault. I highly recommend him!"
