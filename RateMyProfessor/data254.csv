His tests are based off of his power points but you will not understand them if you dont go to class. His tests are okay, but it is a writing emphasis course so there is essay questions. The lab reports are hard but start early and ask him questions and your golden. Although DO NOT take this as your first Geo class! I\'d wait"

It\'s a challenging class. Perhaps taking other geology courses prior to this would help grade wise, but it\'s a class that is very difficult to make an A in, a B is more probable. Make use of office hours for what you don\'t understand, there\'s a lot to learn in this course."
