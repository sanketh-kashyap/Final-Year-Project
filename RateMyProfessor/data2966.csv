So basically the class came down to a midterm, group project and cumulative final. The group project wasn\'t too bad. The midterm was ridiculously easy but the final was outrageously difficult..."

I hated accounting before this class and now it\'s my favorite and I look forward to every class. The class is super fun and she is absolutely clear and solves examples in class which is super helpful. I can\'t recommend her enough. she is amazing! I wish SCU had more teachers like her.

Pretty much our whole class did really well in her class. Three quizzes and a midterm and final. She drops your lowest grade of your three quizzes - but the quizzes are really easy. Take her if you can! I know people in this same class who got D\'s or dropped because they had different teachers - get Siqi

She teaches very fast at times, but presents the material clearly. Her tests are difficult, even though they are comprised of multiple choice and short answer. Midterm, Final, and 2 group projects. She plays favorites, so get on her good side early!"

She can go a little fast a times. Homework is not mandatory, which can be a bad thing if you take a little longer to grasp the concepts. There are two easy projects. Overall, good teacher."

She gives a quiz almost every week, but usually they are short and easy and men that you get out of class early. Actually, you\'ll get out of class early almost every day. No mandatory homework, lots of review on not too much content and one easy group project."
