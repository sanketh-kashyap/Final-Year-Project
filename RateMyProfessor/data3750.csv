If you ask him a question he will try and prove you wrong even if you are right. He tried to tell me that water was ionic. Complete idiot. Gets off topic all the time. Estimates your grade. DO NOT TAKE!

Has great experience in the field of Chemistry, but cannot teach in the least. Truely the worst professor I have ever had. Does not follow syllabus, does not accurately update grades, quizzes are off topic and very difficult, and if you attempt to ask him a question he will get extreemly defensive. Do not take"

Does\'nt know what he\'s talking about. Does\'nt follow syllabus at all. Grading scale is incoherent. If you want to learn about chemistry, DO NOT take his class. However, if you want to learn more about his wife and or are pursuing a career with kodak, take his class"
