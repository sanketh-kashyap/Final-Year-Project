I took her for Comm100 at UIC and the class is super easy and she is really understanding. I REALLY recommend taking her class. It\'s an easy A if you put even a little effort.

The class has zero structure. If you ask a question, she\'ll take the entire class to answer it. The book is actually interesting but it\'s completely unrelated to anything she will ever talk about in class, so be prepared to basically think of class and homework as two different courses. Don\'t take her."

She is very intelligent, passionate, and very genuine and those are some very RARE qualities. I had only one class session with her but she had made a huge impact and impression on me and what she taught just really resonated with me. You will learn so much from her!"

An okay teacher but goes off on tangents too often. Usually seems under the influence of something.
