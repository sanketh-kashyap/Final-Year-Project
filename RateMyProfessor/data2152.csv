So that should give you an idea as to how much the lecture part of J2100 matters. The way she weights grades is beyond me. If you miss one out of-class-assignment, your grade will drop two letters. Even though we have probably 100 assignments throughout the semester."

Other sections don\'t follow a specific beat and we move more fast paced. She doesn\'t allow MU sources either, like other lab sections do. BUT you will learn a lot and become a lot better of a journalist if placed in her class. She\'s not that bad."
