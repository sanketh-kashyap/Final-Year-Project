Amelia  Medrano,California State University Los Angeles,Social Work department, Los Angeles, CA,0,1.0,N/A,4.0,,1,02/04/2009,SW478,1.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Do not take this teacher! Medrano talks and talks but has no formal lecture outline, she hands out a ""study guide"" for the midterm which is not helpful at all, and is not at all helpful through email either. Depend on reading the book completely on your own, her tests are tricky considering her lack of teaching in-class."
