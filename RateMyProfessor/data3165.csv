But in the end he gave us loads of EC and most of the class passed. He\'s really a great guy, just a little hard to understand sometimes."

He tells you one thing will be on the test but either doesnt put it, or puts something completely irrelevant on the test. He cant directly answer a question and his powerpoints have nothing to do with biology. DO NOT TAKE!"
