I am not a huge fan, her classes seem to always be in the same layout. Group discussion every class on the material she just covered, two long papers and no exam. Last exam was 12 pages. She is very knowledgeable but the way she covers the material is so dry."

I got my mark for the first assignment back and then nothing until I received my final grade. In lectures she just talks using the most obscure words she can and then says ""this is really heavy stuff"". It wouldn\'t be so damn heavy if she just spoke like a normal person."

It was a little unorthodox for an undergrad course in that it did host a lot of guest lecturers, however, I personally enjoyed the difference in approach. If it was a graduate class, I would have been more displeased with its format, but at the undergrad level, I think it was great."

There was so much work that was expected of you even though it wouldn\'t be graded. Assignments had to be redone at least 3 times. Very confusing about what she wants from the students. Learned very little actually. End project was somewhat rewarding but not at all worth the suffering.

The exams are usually take-home, and there\'s no midterm- just a simple group assignment. Take her class!"
