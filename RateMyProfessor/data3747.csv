At his own discretion, he let other students off w/ just a warning, which I didn\'t find fair at all. Isn\'t everyone supposed to be held accountable under the same rules? Other than PHIL 101, i have received no grade lower than a B"

I worked SO hard in his class yet it never paid off. I failed this class, my only fail in college. I should have withdrawn. I HATE this class, it wasn\'t even good NOR made sense. DO NOT TAKE. EVER. Worst decision i EVER made. Ruined my transcript."

Sometimes he moved a little slow for me, but I have more prior experience with philosophical reading than a lot of kids in my class did. He explains everything very, very clearly. He\'s incredibly approachable and friendly as can be. He\'s a very fair grader, and he\'s full of information. Great guy, great teach."

Very interesting and approachable. Class always had a relaxing mood to it and was interesting. I went into it thinking it would be a useless class but I got a lot out of it. 4 HW\'s and 2 tests. Very fair grader and he gives you the questions that will be on the tests. Great class overall.

But that is in part to the fact that I openly hate Philosophy. Pete is an awesome guy though and always goes out of his way to make students comfortable.

He\'s an amazing prof! Made class a lot of fun. VERY approachable. Made critical reasoning very easy to understand. The textbook is written by him and is mandatory (only $16 at copy center, or free online). 4 HWs, 2 exams. We also watched some films. Attendance is mandatory! Miss 4 and he fails you."

But spent way too much time on certain articles and neglecting the more fun ones. Tests were all essays, but gave test questions out ahead of time, and is a fair grader, also giving opportunities for extra credit and extensions. Is great with emails and ultra-nice and understanding!"
