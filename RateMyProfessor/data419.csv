Leslie  Dreifus,Brooklyn College,Business department, Brooklyn, NY,1,2.8,N/A,3.3,,4,12/23/2010,BUSMGMT,4.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Has a great sense of humor. Do homeworks, attend class regulary, PARTICIPATE. You can just skim through the textbook and ace the midterm and final. 10 page business plan due at end of semester. He gives tons of extra credit for final and midterm. I RECOMMEND!"

If you fail the midterm, and on the final if you get 75, you are fine. A 10 pages term paper is also helpful to improve your grade, as well as class attendance and home works."

I don\'t understand how come he assigns a 10-15 page term paper which contains 40% of final grade. Dude, this is a finance class. Students are here to learn financial calculation, not to write a term paper about silly issues. Most of the materials we learned by ourselves. Very hard to understand & not helpful at all."
