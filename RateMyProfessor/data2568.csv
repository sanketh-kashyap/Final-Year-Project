This guy is awesome. He is very intelligent and chill so its not a difficult class to pass. The subjects he chooses to talk about are real life situations going on around us and can be controversial so if you get heated easily maybe don\'t take him. He is a cool guy and if you do the few essays he assigned. He inspired me 4sur

He likes to be on the opposite end of an argument about very controversial topics just to get you talking about it. Not going to lie this class is pretty boring and you don\'t do much but what videos bit it was super easy. Only 3 papers and the rest of the grading is response questions to articles. Easy A"

His class is not a religious class. Religion does bleed into the topic of abortion, but you cant talk about abortion and not religion.

Easiest teacher out there. Wrote three papers the whole class while keeping a journal every class period, with responses to his own poetry or other topics.

He is helpful and his class isn\'t difficult as long as you show up for class. He makes you write about 4 essays for the whole semester and he will let you re write them for a better grade. I ended up taking his class again for 201 C and it was also a very good class. I highly suggest taking his class!

His class is decent in difficulty, but what he lacks in ease, he more than makes up for in clever class conversation. Of all my years in school, I enjoyed his class more than any I\'ve taken. His wit eased the controversial topics we assessed. This teacher is far from the easiest, but is definately worth taking!!!"
