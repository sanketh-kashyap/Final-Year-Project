His lectures were always clear, he had us do worksheets together in class, and you knew exactly what to study for the tests. He\'d even give us a few ""despair"" photos at the beginning of his lecture slideshow with hilarious captions to brighten our moods before class."

As we settled into the class, however, I realized that Rholy is a few things: he is very funny, incredibly smart, and he is respectful and helpful with his feedback. Also being super nice helps."

He makes class fun and interesting. His tests are super easy if you pay attention in class. No surprises on test. I recommend taking him if you have the chance. I had him for gen chem. 1. At first, he seems odd, but he is literally so great!"

You know EXACTLY what to expect for his exams and he takes time to go through material. He\'s also super nice and really funny which helps class not feel so brutal. 10/10 would recommend others to take him for Gen Chem 1 or 2.

He was very helpful, loved chemistry, kept the class fun with chem related jokes and a witty sense of humor and prepared us well for the standardized chem exam. VERY good class. I decided to minor in chem because of him!"

He really tries to help you understand the material. I rated this as a 3 on hardness not because he is hard, but just because the material itself can be hard. One day we had the other gen chem teacher b/c Rohly was at a conference, and he was super hard to understand and had no structure. Definatley choose Rohly."

He makes difficult concepts easy to understand. Makes an effort to learn your name. If you ask him a question he will explain the answer so that you can understand it. One of the most difficult classes I\'ve ever taken, but his teaching style helped a lot! Wish he could be my Chemistry professor forever!"
