Cathy  Egan,University of Maryland,English department, College Park, MD,0,4.5,N/A,4.0,,1,02/05/2009,ENGL222,4.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"The book selection, barring House of Mirth and Oscar Wao (which is one of the most obnoxious books I have ever read), was very good. As an english major I appreciate that. She really doesn\'t give out A\'s on papers though which I found a bit frustrating, but exams are graded much easier. Overall, it was a very beneficial class and I highly rec. it."
