Not only does she care about women, but she cares about every person she comes across. So understanding, so helpful, and so funny. A must take at NCC."

Carin not only teaches in class but coaches students! She even guides in the business, helping to take headshots, production photos, albums, etc. I\'m still amazed that she has her own company (The Other Theatre Company) and if you\'re good you could be there eventually. Go Carin!"

She is very popular with the students because she is cool and she teaches all the classes that make you want to be in theatre, and makes them very fun. Only complaint would be she kind of plays favorites, she\'s fair in class, but outside it\'s very clear who she\'s buddies with."
