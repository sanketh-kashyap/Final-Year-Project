He takes the time to help you with proper journalism structure and overall understanding of the profession. He let the students run the newspaper and helped them understand design and ethics. AP stylebook will be a must throughout a journalism career."

Aside from watching 4 pretty good movies, he gives 1 essay per week (750 words). When you get your grade, you can ask him to re-grade your paper, and he usually will give you 5-10 extra points. I strongly recommend this guy if you want to take the easy way out!"

I took this class over the summer wasnt hard at all 1 essay a week and that was basically it. This was my relaxing class compared to the others such as CIS 105...not really much homework other than the essay and readings (that dont get quized on)

However he is absent quite a bit so I recommend NOT making this the only class you take unless you have a contact at school that can tell you if there is class or not for that day. Expect to report what\'s going on in the news each day as this is a continuous homework assignment. AP style is KEY in this class.

You will have to write several news stories & will use associated press style book. I wish he wasn\'t absent so much! He likes to ask, What\'s in the news? & other things. 1 day he changed the class meeting time."
