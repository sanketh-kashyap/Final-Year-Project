The teacher apprciates that people have to take the class and breaks it down into easy steps. Open book/open note tests! You do have to show up every week but it is worth it!

Gives you the easy way to do the problems without bogging you down on the way the book does it. Must be in class every week though, miss one class and that can make it tough being its math"
