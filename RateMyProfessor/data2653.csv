Seems very informative with some aspects of the class, however she changes things on D2L content often so check your stuff every day."

YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,She comes off a little cold at first but she\'s actually really nice. She has a lot of passion for teaching future educators. No tests in her class but quite a few papers. You have a project at the end of the semester that\'s really simple but your journal for field experience is a ton of work.

I believe she is one of my easiest classes. Yes, she asks for a lot and you have quite a few assignments but she lays them out for you and tells your EXACTLY what to do and what is expected in the class. I think she is a GREAT teacher!"

This is kind of helpful for teaching techniques, but when she grades its your work she is extremely tough. She does give a lot of feedback though. If you take her for lower division (easy)and then take her for upper division (insanely hard) you will see 2 completely different people."

By this I mean she says she is not sure about a lot of things. Also, if you don\'t understand something she is very rude. The work for this class is interesting though."
