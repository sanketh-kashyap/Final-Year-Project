She will challenge you. Only bad thing is, she is a very liberal thinker and tries to push it off on you. For example, she will have you read liberal papers for homework. Other than that, she is great."

There\'s quite a bit of writing involved, which is great for me because I love it, and some reading. I am already a better writer because of her. She\'s by far the best teacher I\'ve ever had! She\'s tiny, but fierce! I will always carry her teachings with me."

She\'s entertaining and can be sarcastic but in the end a very good professor to take for English. Take her class if you can.

She\'s tough and wants everyone to have extreme ideas and opinions to make her life interesting. She\'ll give you a bad grade without telling you what to do or what not to do."

Her assignments are not hard or long, but unless your up for a challenge, take the 16 week course. We had homework just about every class. Alot of reading but the stories are short and interesting. I enjoyed her class and would take her again. Buying the text books are mandatory."

I was scared at first but loved her class. I am waiting for her to teach 1302. I took the class at night with a full course load and work. Its not hard unless you make it hard.

If you want to be an english teacher or a writer this might be for you . but if you work or have a heavy class schedule Run!she is tough when it comes to grading papers.
