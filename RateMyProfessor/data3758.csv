I would definitely recommend taking her class.

Everyone would find out upon arrival to school. This didn\'t make since considering she lived three hours away so she would know a good while ahead of time if she wasn\'t going to be there.. Didn\'t really teach us apart from the book. Really just a nightmare class for me. Hated every second.

No need to go to class, you could teach yourself. Ask her a question and watch her squirm for real. Tests were longgg but fairly easy. Grading was fair. Was pretty but wore the weirdest stuff. Homework every class alot of it."
