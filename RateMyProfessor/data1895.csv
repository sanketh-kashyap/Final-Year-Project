Catherine  Stewart,Mount Mercy University,Education department, Cedar Rapids, IA,0,4.0,N/A,2.0,,1,02/01/2009,ED102,4.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I took Foundations with Sister Catherine and it was a fairly easy class. The daily quizzes out of the 1st book are basically all bolded or italicized wording from the text. I did not read any of those chapters. The second book is hard to read and the quizzes are also fairly difficult.
