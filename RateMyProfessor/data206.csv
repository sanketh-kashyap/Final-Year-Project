Her teaching style is a little confusing but the class is certainly not difficult. Graded on a curve. There are a few small quizzes, a midterm, a presentation, and a take home final. The class is mostly discussion. It was scary at first, but you get used to it."

It was really just fun. She often got sidetracked, and told us random insights into french culture. The quizes were easy, and it was easy to do well and learn the basics of the language. Homework was everynight, but it really wasn\'t too much work."

Tests are premature, yet she doesn\'t seem to mind. She is terrible at explaining any lessons. Expect a lousy power point and minor details on any given subject. WHY WONT THIS WOMAN TEACH US?"

Yes, she is a dr. of her own language, but this woman is incomprehensible. A quiz will be given before the information is taught and the tests are beyond realistic. it is possible to achieve a desired grade, but not a love of the language from this woman. she will instill your mind with fear. avoid at all costs"
