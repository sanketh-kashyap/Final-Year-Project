She\'s young and blonde lol. She gives you the confidence boost to speak better in front of others. I came into this class dreading it but my last speech I aced it and couldn\'t have done it without all of her help, plus the practice of many speeches. If you\'re taking speech, go with her! Truly the best and funny too."
