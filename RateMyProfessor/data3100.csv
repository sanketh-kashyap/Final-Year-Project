RESPECTED,2,0,"Dr. Schroeder is one of the best professors I\'ve had at the University. He\'s very understanding of the lifestyle of students, while having a deep understanding of the material he teaches. He\'s not very loud, but more than makes up for it with interesting lectures. There are no tests, just 3 essays that are graded leniently with lenient due dates."

His lectures can be long and dry at times, but you end up learning so much from him. He is willing to help out students if they need it. He assigns a lot of reading, but you can get away without reading if you listen during lectures. Overall, his class was a great experience!"

He\'s a nice guy and he\'s clearly pretty knowledgeable, but he\'s also a rambling, un-engaging lecturer. Lectures seemed to drag on forever and he often got off topic. DON\'T take a class of his unless you have to."

He repeats themes a lot; write them down and study them before the midterm, I did and got a 99. Final was a 10-12 page paper, but didn\'t involve any independent research and he loves it if you just parrot back what he said in class. Cool guy, interesting class, definitely recommend it."

Show up to class and you\'re golden. He gives a lot of useless readings but his tests are fair and he always clues you in in class on the questions.
