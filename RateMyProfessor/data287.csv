Tests aren\'t too bad, DO THE REVIEW, its practically the test with a few minor changes. My biggest problem with this class was the homework. Its given 2-3 times a week with about 20 probs each. But she only grades 4 questions so if you miss 2 you get a 50."

She goes way too fast with her explanations. I got an A only because I\'d taken calc in high school. But just stay away

Unwilling to help students, aggravated by those who have questions, and disrespectful to many students. I have a full time job and attend university. I spend my time and money here to be challenged, not to be treated like a delinquent that she has no time for."

Make sure you do the test review because it is basically the test. She just changed number. Don\'t know why so many dislike her. I did excellent in her class. Always make sure you know how to do every problem on her review.

Said ""staff"" so I didn\'t know I was taking her. She CANNOT teach! Hates to be proven wrong. Double check your test, she marked a question wrong on my test & I told her. She admitted she made a mistake but would not give me credit! Passed class with a C, final exam is what saved me. Counts 40%. Show lots of work on free response!!!"

Does example after example with no explanation or reasoning. Tests are free response so if you mess up wrong screwed. Mymathlab teaches the class better than she does, started going to class and taking notes and they did not help at all. Wolframalpha and Mathlab helped me."

Everything i learned was from the homework or spending literally hours in the help center doing her test reviews. Her test are 13 questions and she grades the free response harshly. If you are willing to put the effort and time to learn on your own take her. She teaches talks to the board the whole class

She never actually teaches anything. She lectures to the chalkboard doing example after example never explaining why she\'s doing something a certain way. Tests are always less than 15 questions so there is never any room for mistakes. Don\'t take her if possible!

She has great handwriting, which I think is pretty important for teaching math. She isn\'t the best at fielding questions during the lecture, but if you visit her office she is extremely helpful."

Her hw assignments were so big that there were times when no one in the class had been able to complete it, and the examples she gave in class did not relate to the hw or the test problems. Her tests were easy because she gave reviews, but I would not recommend this professor."

Also, I think the examples she gives in class are sometimes irrelevant to what the problems cover. However, her tests are so easy, and she loves having students ask her homework questions during her office hours. She is a great teacher!"

Expect to spend at least ten to twenty minutes per problem near the end of the semester. On the plus side, the tests are fairly simple, but your homework grade will suffer."

She still gives out hw every day, but she communicates regularly with the class, does not require attendance, and is fairly lenient with students skipping ""obvious"" steps. Calculus is just a hard topic."

Math is my strong subject, and I\'ve always been good at it. She was so awful, I had to drop the class. And I attend every class! She goes through lectures quickly, and doesn\'t really understand how to answer difficult questions. I would definitely not recommend her."

She does not talk to your or teach you, she talks to the chalk board saying do this do that, but not explaining everything she is doing. Uses words that are over the top and very understandable. Gives about an average of 40 problems due every class and only grades 10 of them...TERRIBLE TEACHER!!!"

Do not take her for your math class. She uses words that are hard to understand and makes concepts much harder than they have to be. She does not know how to explain things very well and goes way over the top. Gives out too much homework to only grade 5 of the problems.
