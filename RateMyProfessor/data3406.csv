She was pretty much useless for notes and for any in class learning on the information that was to be included in exams. She made it seem like she was helping you out with every exam, but that is bogus, it is just a way to try and make up for lack of teaching"

I did not like the fact that written answers had had to come from the book. Felt very middle school-like. So did the excessive amount of busy work."

She makes you want to learn about Soc. If you are shy I would recommend not to take this class because she highly values class discussions. Gives you all the information you need to pass exams."

She makes the class super fun! My class was 3 hours long and it went by really fast. I would highly recommend her to other students.
