Outlines were passed out to go with the chapters in the book. Read your book, study the outlines & you will pass. Not crucial to have to attend every lecture, as it all comes directly from the text, but she helps clarify the info. Possible point deduction for poor attendance."

Tests were more than fair, tons of extra credit on them and she gives you a heads up to the extra credit is before the test and so you know going in. Take her"
