If a student has a difficulties to understand something she would tell the student that google it or go to the library and ask for another grammar book to help with your struggle. She teaches this class as a HYBRID class, everything is online. It\'s a waste of time and money."

If you take her class, it won\'t be very easy. However, your English will have improved substantially by the end of the class. It was a pleasure for me to be Glenda\'s student. Hope you enjoy her class as much as I did."
