Completely a waste of time . She just go back and forward and is very confused. Mrs Robert likes to play games in her classes and is very boring also makes you repeat over and over what others said, and yes she love to makes jokes but they aren\'t funny. I don\'t recommend her classes for those who have academic goals"

The books, she chose to read, those books automatically makes you to read more. I liked all three of books that she chose. Sometimes she helps you pronuce some words. I would recommened every ENSL student to take ENSL B31 withh her."
