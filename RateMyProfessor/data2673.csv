He has a ton of experiences which he discusses making the courses interesting. Not the most organized, but if you\'re interested and participate, you\'ll do well"

As long as you pay attention and keep up with your assignments you will pass. I thought I had a B in the class and ended up with an A!

Obviously he has never taught before because I have never had a professor go an ENTIRE semester giving multiple assignments..and have about 2 quizzes and 1 or 2 tests handed back...EXTREMELY unorganized, not helpful. Won\'t answer emails. Messed up my final grade, didn\'t have any assignments or grade to show."
