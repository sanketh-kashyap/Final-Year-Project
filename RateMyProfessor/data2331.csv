Final optional if you are happy with your grade. Very easygoing and personable. Teaches various psych and statistics courses at ASU also. Definitely recommend Dr Lewis for anything stats related.

Take into account that we\'re talking about statistics here. Not an exciting topic, and not easy. read the chapters, walk into class confused, but you\'ll understand by the time you walk out. He\'ll explain things over and over again until you understand, but you have to speak up."
