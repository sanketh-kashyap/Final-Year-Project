He makes the sometimes difficult and confusing subject matter easy to understand and is always more than patient and helpful with anyone who has a question. There is homework due almost every class, but the homework he gives is your chance to exercise what he teaches in class. Classes go by quickly."

GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK  LOTS OF HOMEWORK,0,0,"Amazing teacher. Goes above and beyond to help his students out, preparing detailed answer and study guides, holding off campus office hours, anything he can do to help you understand the material, which can definitely be tricky. Also pretty funny- basically an awkward, shamelessly geeky guy who loves dissecting arguments. Take his class."

Homework every class but most of it\'s very easy. VERY helpful if you don\'t understand. Easy to get a hold of. Kind of scatter-brained. Moves around a lot. Kinda geeky but a good teacher for sure. A strong recommendation from me.

He will go out of his way to help you with everything. The class can get tuff at the end, but not horrible. He likes to joke a lot too, which keeps the class very casual. Great teacher.

He gives you a study guide before each quiz that contains all of the information you need to know. Assignments consisted of 3 quizzes (multiple choice, short answer, and essay) and a take-home final. Cool guy, very conversational and explains things so they\'re easy to understand."
