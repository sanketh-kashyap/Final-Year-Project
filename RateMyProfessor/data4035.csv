I was scared at first because of all the reviews he had but he\'s actually really cool, teaches clear, he reviews for tests, goes over anything you are confused about. If he were to teach math31 for the coming semester I would so take it but he won\'t be. Does give a lot of hw and gives tests every two weeks."

I spent a lot of nights studying for his tests and doing his homework which were pretty hard as I didn\'t have a solid math background but in the long run it helped me immensely. Most of the classwork consists of reading the textbook or whiteboard but if you need help just ask!

He gives the same amount of hw just like any other math teacher. Always hands out a review sheet before the test. If he sees your trying he will do everything in his power to help you learn the material. My favorite math professor at SMC.

Easy tests. Easy homework. Show that you\'re trying and you\'ll get a good grade. The only downside with him is that he spends the whole class with the textbook and the whiteboard and not interacting with us unless we ask him a question.
