You should have a solid understanding of Calculus before you take him. He does have pop quizzes, and doesn\'t check the hw. Often gets a little sidetracked. One class we spent the first 25 minutes talking about ancient instruments from the greeks."

YOU WON\'T PASS.,1,0,McChesney is definitely a strange guy and loves going off on tangents. His notes aren\'t very structured and its better to focus more on his explanations than what he\'s writing down (He doesn\'t really label sections or chapters). Hw is optional but do it anyways. His exams range from some of the hardest to very simple. Luckily also scales often.

I had to take a pr-calculus course with him, the class had no sttructure, his notes were all over the place, and we were quizzed on material we briefly or never went over in class. When I would go to him for extra help, or ask questions, he was rude."

This is a Four day class, with 8 hrs of homework a week tops. I suck at math."

I do not suggest a class with him unless you are talented at math and are up to taking the most miserable difficult calculus tests known to man. If you ask questions he says \'you should have learned that in your last class\'. Besides that he seems really interesting though.
