Very nice lady and she\'s definitely a person to go to if you\'re a psych major (like me!). Powerpoint lectures, group work, five exams, videos, some extra credit opportunities. Arrive to class ON TIME. If you\'re late, she might not let you into class for the day. I plan on taking her other Psych courses."

I took her for psych 12 too. She is clear and her exams reflect her lectures. Go to class and take notes you will do fine. Her class consists of 5 exams of 50 multiple questions. 3 group work activities and 1 research paper. She gives you options for extra credit. She really takes notice of those who really try.

She gave us lots of extra credit and is pretty understanding as long as you let her know whats going on. She\'s big on going to lecture and don\'t bother coming in if you\'re late. She will kick you out. Don\'t text because she does keep a look out. I basically passed because of the group work, extra credit, and final paper."
