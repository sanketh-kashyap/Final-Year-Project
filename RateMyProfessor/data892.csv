YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,1,"I was so excited to get proper instruction for painting but Les ruined my experience. ""Feedback"" was very passive aggressive, teaching methods didn\'t make sense (eg. can\'t listen to music because it\'s distracting, heavy lectures and expects you to finish within 1.5hrs), etc. I admit I\'m not the best painter but I\'d rather have a different prof"

If you don\'t come to class, he won\'t be sympathetic. Talk to him if you have a problem getting something in on time or with your grades, he\'ll listen and help you if he can. He doesn\'t sugarcoat and you can learn a lot from him. Overall, great painting teacher but be patient."

Yes, he is hard when it comes to his marking, but honestly if you pay attention to his lessons, you\'ll do just fine, otherwise your grades will suffer."

He has very high standards for an intro class and basically tore apart our work with destructive criticism in front of the entire class. Also, gives no sympathy to people who don\'t attend class(even with a legitimate reason). Failed me because he thought I had ""given up"" (quoted from his response to my email)"

He likes to get his students interested and motivated. At times, he\'s humorous during his lectures. He\'s definitely the type of instructors that more art schools need around these days. Yes, he can be pretty tough on you, but it\'s for your benefit."
