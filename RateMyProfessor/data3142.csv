Very easy to understand and incorporates plenty of humor into the lecture to keep you interested. As long as you show up, take notes, and apply them to the study guide (that he gives you) then you really can\'t fail. He is a stickler for at least semi-proper grammar, but it\'s college, that should be a given."

There were 4 exams with two parts in them. 1 part you have to write a paragraph to a question he assigns, he is very picky on grammar.The other part is done online. Overall, i thought he was great.You will learn a lot from him."
