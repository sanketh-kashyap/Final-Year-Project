Professor is a little confusing but I\'m glad I took this class with her, because she knows what she\'s talking about."

Work is easy as long as you can keep up with her schedule. Due dates and times change constantly and the overall class is VERY UNORGANIZED. She barely ever answers e-mails or forum questions. Take her class only if YOU are very organized."

She is energetic and hardworking and she wants to model that behavior, though at times she seems to be belittling the students. Her guidance on resume writing is very valuable and she has strong convictions about your success. Her coursework is very disorganized but her leniency makes up for it."

She does not give out tests! Lots of weekly hw such as quizzes, papers, reports etc. Keeps her students in class for 3 hrs without a break! Talks a lot, but overall very nice lady. You also barely use the textbook, so I wouldn\'t bother buying it."

She doesn\'t make it clear what EXACTLY you need to have done for the class and when it is due. She also changes the syllabus a week through the class. Syllabus and requirements are all over the place. Very unorganized especially in her online classes.

Seems to forget what she has requested of her classes, or confuses assignments. ""Does not believe there is a perfect paper,"" her own quote. Slow to respond via e-mail. Tries to be helpful. Read the book yourself, just don\'t go too far ahead because she may not get that far with the class."

NEVER responds to email, not helpful at all. Forgets to give us break in 3 hour class because she loves to hear herself talk and won\'t shut up long enough to look at a clock. Can talk for hours on any subject...and she will. The work is easy if you can get over her suckiness"

I actually liked coming to her class. it was three hours long but never felt like it. She is funny and has great stories. As the other person said, maybe her syllabus has mistakes but she corrects them and is very clear about what is due when. Midterm & Final are take home. One of my favorite teachers ever."

Never responds to your emails. Syllabus had errors- she corrected them and redistributed, but they were copied in B&W-the days where assignmetns were due were highlighted RED! First exam had 7 duplicate questions out of 17. Nevertheless, VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE on subject matter"
