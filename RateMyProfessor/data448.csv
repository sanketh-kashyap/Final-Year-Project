His lectures are very interesting. I wasnt into architecture at all but he talks about the buildings and their architecture somehow that you\'d want to know more and go to class each session. DO NOT buy any of the books he asks for. I bought all three and didnt even open them once. 3 tests but are easy and 2 extra credit.

This was my first semester at SJSU coming from community college. I found he graded somewhat hard on written test responses and the essay. There were 3 tests a long with a research paper. You need to have a strong understanding of the buildings to do well.

I found his lectures very engaging, even though he sometimes paused to ask the class a question, and no-one would answer (too tired or too shy) so he would wait until they did *groan*.

Group paper topics were limited and didn\'t spark my interest. Having to do a group presentation made me feel like I\'d taken 5 steps back into high school. The test format was the worst part of the course. They were strictly timed. Definitions needed to be regurgitated verbatim back on the page. This taught me nothing.
