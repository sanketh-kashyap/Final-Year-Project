He\'s little disorganized, but very approachable. He has study sessions for those who are lagging behind. The class is not rocket science so if you pay adequate attention you can get an A."

He was confusing, disorganized, & not very helpful. He is a grad student, & that was very clear to the class. Not a single person in my class enjoyed him as our professor. If there is another professor available, take that class. If not, wait until the next semester for a different teacher. Trust me. Run."

I passed with an A. Boesiger isn\'t horrible, but not great either. You basically do the work and you should be fine. He was a little unclear on some stuff, but overall a decent teacher. Attendance not mandatory, but recommended to get good grade. You absolutely need the textbook to pass."
