Had Short Fiction workshop with him and it was very fun and engaging. The quizzes are kind of a joke, and the journals were as well. However, you do learn alot. He\'s very clear, also very funny and interesting. If you can take him, definitely do so. Great man."

The books we read (minus one) were very interesting and easy reads. I loved Appalachian Lit, and you can tell how much he loves teaching it. I could listen to him talk all day long too, with that accent."
