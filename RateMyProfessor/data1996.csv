Fortunately, his exam questions are straightforward and easy. He explains econometric concepts clearly in class and his three TAs are all very helpful during their discussion sessions and office hours."

Without a doubt the worst lecturer I\'ve ever had, can\'t even explain the simplest of ideas without stumbling all over himself and completely missing the point. Can\'t teach to save his life. Was also very rude the one time I dared to ask a question."

Stumbles over himself the entire time, focusing on trivial concepts, neglecting the bigger ones. I wasn\'t looking forward to taking 55, and he didn\'t make it any better. Stay far, far away, unless you want to teach yourself."

Constantly made mistakes while he was speaking, and students often corrected him during class. I basically had to teach myself. Test wasn\'t too bad though, he definitely could have made it harder."

Doesnt seem to care how well his students do in the class; it was a rough transition from 51 with Leachman, who at least taught everything on the tests and was there to help, despite being a hard grader."
