Required a book published this year, but never gave a single assignment from it. I want my money back! Wasn\'t helpful with questions, couldn\'t figure out how the course blackboard worked, graded inconsistently. Only really gave 3 assignments, if one isn\'t good, you\'re screwed."

The first paper we wrote really stressed me out, but everything else was easygoing. he made it clear that you have to bust your butt to get an a. I don\'t believe that was entirely true, or if it was just that clear and easy to me. great prof, interesting class minus the poems."
