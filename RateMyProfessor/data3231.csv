She truly did not grade you on your opinion, but only on how well you supported yourself. I pulled off an 85 in the class, easy. Jill is totally approachable, and so understanding. Her essay prompts are very clear!"

Was willing to help after hours, had a lot of class discussions. She was pretty tough..If you like war literature it is a good class but not the nicest."
