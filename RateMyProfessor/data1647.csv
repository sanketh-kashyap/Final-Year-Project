She made us spend $200+ on art supplies we never use, had us write a ton of useless papers and is impossible to please. She hates everyone\'s art and is condescending. She even made a girl cry in the middle of class. This woman made me never want to take another art class."

How can art be ""wrong?"" Plus she\'s no fun to look at. Do not take her for basic design. The projects she assigns require us to spend a minimum of 6-7 hours out of class doing and redoing stupid projects."

I can\'t believe they re-upped her for next semester. She drags the department down. Her assignments were ridiculous and stupid and she forced students to installation even when that is not their focus. She should be fired."

She is disorganized, insulting, condescending, rude, and her requirements for fulfilling the ever-changing course objectives, as they changed daily, were impossible. Definitely would NEVER recommend. Avoid her classes like the plague if you love art and want to stay with it!"

She originally had one paper in the syllabus and has added three more that she grades ridiculously and doesnt tell you what she is looking for. I do not recommend her. she ruined my love of art.

She teaches the class as if she was teaching grad school.She knows alot of information but doesnt really know what she is doing. We didnt actually start doing anything in her class until 3 weeks into the semester.
