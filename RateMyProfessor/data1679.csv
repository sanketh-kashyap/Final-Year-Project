Very curt in her responses to problems within the classroom. Openly partial toward certain students. I would never take a class from her knowing what I know now.

I took an online class from Elaine via Capella. She does a nice job and is very present in the discussion boards. She seems to be constantly looking for ways to make her courses even better. Nice work.

Just tells you you made a mistake, but not how to correct it. Didn\'t teach the class and barely facilitated it. Very little interaction with students."

More interested in how students attend to the specifics of her instructions rather on quality/depth of understanding of material. Don\'t bother spending days doing research or studying. Just stay in her bounds. Very negative and sketchy feedback. Interesting subject though.
