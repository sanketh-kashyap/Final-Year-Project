I sometimes found he was on a different wave length in discussions and seemed to have an agenda or personal opinion he was pushing rather than letting the students explore the ideas independently. I like him as a person, not sure I\'d take a class of his again."

As a student of color I\'ve found his classes engaging & felt respected & valued- even while we dealt with topics of class & global identity. I have tremendous respect for him esp b/c he is courageous enough to admit when he\'s wrong."

He grades papers relatively hard. Do not come to his class unprepared, he will embarrass you and use you as the example of what not to do. He is very passionate and engaged in his teaching and expects the same interest from you."

It\'s worth it tho, as you will learn more in this class than pretty much any other. He\'s brilliant. Totally knows his stuff and EXPECTS you to as well. Do not try to bs his, he will call you on it in class. He\'s funny tho and class is enjoyable, but a expect a lot of work."

He also is very helpful, and tries to understand each student\'s situation. His class is not a easy though, and you should only take his class if you are willing to work hard."

Otherwise he will not have patience with you. He can always detect bs. However, if you do your best he will be very supportive, and he really knows what he\'s teaching. Good writing skills are a must-have."

You\'ll read nearly every day, and you\'ll probably have to turn in 3""x5"" cards every day with quotes and comments written on them. He grades papers relatively severely. Good classroom energy. Sometimes insulting or cocky. Frankly, he can be an ass."

Senior Sem was OK, but I thought that he is a little confused about where he stands as a professor, a little useless in some areas (but great comments in ANYTHING in writing- very helpful and well-spoken).
