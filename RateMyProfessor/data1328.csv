The most difficult part for me was the online homeworks that will take up a lot of your time and only 2 test that you either pass or fail.

He is somewhat hard to understand, but not too bad. He only has a midterm and a final for tests, but he does quizzes every class that are open book and can use friends to help you. The homework doesn\'t match anything the test, and it\'s all online, so it was useless."

Quiz\'s everyday, but done w/people around you which helps your grade. Homework once a week that takes hours and is mandatory, and difficult. Very helpful and kind. Helpful in and outside of class, definitely worth taking. Exams are pretty easy, but only two (midterm and final)"

I took him for chem 1411 and 1412 during the summer and the class was not that tough. Why? Because I did the homework, attended class, and studied for tests.

His accent would be difficult enough to decipher at a normal pace, much less the cheetah-like speed at which he talks. Definitely not conducive to learning a difficult subject like chemistry."
