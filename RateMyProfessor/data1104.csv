Her comments are super clear and thoughtful, and she will take the extra time to really help you get better on every single paper. Made me a better writer and also more analytical in my work. Hands down my favorite professor so far."

Found her to be fairly tough but very fair. Somewhat short with students in class but is more patient and understanding during office hours and meetings. Gives out homework and pop quizzes to the point where it feels like an undergrad course. Hot is a gross understatement when describing her looks.

In class she\'s a decent lecturer. Tests can have both trick and easy questions so make no assumptions. May pelt you with busywork if you are in her Legal Analysis class.

Her lectures were engaging and she had a great sense of humor. I personally found her to be an incredible female role model. She is completely fair on her tests and throws out questions that didn\'t make sense as well as curves grades. I very much recommend both this course and Prof. Rosen.

She posted almost all of her lecture slides online, so attending class was not necessary. Be sure to read the books and ask questions, as she is very helpful."

There is not a lot of homeowrk, jsut reading, your grade is based on 3 tests."
