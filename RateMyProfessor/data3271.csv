Makes everyone do posts over blackboard and it is part of the grade (which I felt was a complete waste of time). Gives 3 actually essays and the last 2 were revisions of previous essays. Did not enjoy the class.

She only wants to read and grade essays that interest her, so she will tell you to change your topic if she does not like it. Also she has 32 posts on blackboard in which you do useless nonsense, like writing a thesis for your essay, then changing it 5 times to make it ""better"" for your essay."
