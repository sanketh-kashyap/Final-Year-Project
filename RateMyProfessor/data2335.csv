Anita  Ross,Georgia Military College,Biology department, Warner Robins, GA,0,1.5,N/A,4.0,,1,02/03/2009,BIO123,1.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"If you\'re looking for an aggressive professor who prompts student interaction and exhibits a clear passion towards the class they\'re teaching, avoid taking Mrs.Ross\' BIO course. She reads directly from power point (provided by course studies, not created herself) notes and yields to explain content any further. She\'s extremely vague."
