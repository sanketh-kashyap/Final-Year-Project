His class was pretty difficult for me, and he was quite difficult to get an email response from, even during his listed office hours. Hes not the nicest teacher Ive had, and Im a decent student. He also doesnt exactly grade in a timely manner. Final grade: A"

Its as if he\'s hearing something entirely different and his response will be to whatever that was. He unnecessarily shares his political and religious opinions; deliberately encouraging controversial and unrelated discussions among the students. He interrupts and demeans.

He organizes everything very well. Any of the times I didn\'t understand something or had a question, he responded to emails pretty quickly (except on weekends). To be honest he might be a little too good for the school. He has a ton of knowledge about the subject, he\'s just really tough."

He can be a bit slow to return emails and calls. However I know that he teaches a TON of classes at WCC and is working on his own education. So he is a busy guy. All in all I think he is an outstanding teacher. He lets you know what he expects right up front follow that and you will be do fine.
