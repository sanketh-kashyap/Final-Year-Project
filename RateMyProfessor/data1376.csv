She talks down to her students and belittles them. She constantly makes faces at anyone who speaks up in class. I would NOT reccommend any of her classes. I\'m not sure why she\'s a teacher when she so clearly is not into her job.

She makes you feel stupid when you ask questions, and acts pretty snobby. She likes to belittle her students, just drop her class if enrolled."

Her grading policies are for lack of a better word; poor. I was very confident in my public speaking before this class and afterwards have been knocked down a few pegs.

At times it was extremely frustrating to receive a grade from her as I felt it wasn\'t appropriate to the level of work I put into the assignment. Towards the end I kind of gave up because I didn\'t see a point. On the plus side she fostered a nice class environment.

Then, once mid-term hits, she is impatient, and disrespectful of her students when they ask her a clarifying question, or if they speak with her about attendance or tardies. Grading seems a bit strange, and very subjective. get on her good side."
