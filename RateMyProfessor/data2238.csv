The homework was online, and her teaching method was based off of her, not the online book, so solving the problems online was difficult. Avoid her if you can."

I had taken stats before this class and literally the material is so easy but her grading is SO bad ! she has no idea what she is talking about and sometimes asks the class what she thinks she should do. when you get testsquizzes back check her grading !!

Her lectures made me really not want to come to class because she literally teaches out of the book same with the examples she uses in class. I can read and look at examples on my own. She makes a lot of mistakes too so if you have her pay attention to your work if you get it back.
