We don\'t go over the things for the next ch just learn it ourselves at home. Also his daily quizzes are basically test over the chapter that you haven\'t covered yet. Doesn\'t usually come to class prepared with what he is going to teach."

Be aware: he is totally faithful to his own rules, syllabus and school guidelines."

Cares about his students. Expects a lot from his students. He comes class prepared and expects his students to be prepared for class.

You will like him early on in the first couple of semesters, then get progressively more frustrated in NT Greek I & II (especially II) till you can\'t wait to get out. It\'s not the Greek, it\'s the class. Workload is progressively more ridiculous, teaching is sometimes muddled, and grading is often arbitrary."

Great sense of humor and you can tell he loves what he teaches. He does expect a lot out of his students and what he puts into us he gets out. Homework load is high but if you put effort into it the reward is great. Make him your greek prof, you won\'t be disappointed!"
