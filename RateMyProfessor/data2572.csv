There are only 3 things you are graded on, midterm, final, and one lit review. He has weekly optional 45 minute lectures, which helps if you have questions about the assigned readings. The tests are entirely based on the textbook. The readings were only one chapter a week from the textbook, which was light."

Online chats weren\'t mandatory but quite helpful for questions. The paper had clear criteria despite being long but that\'s expected when there is only the midterm/final (fair exams, just study, of course). The textbook was necessary - I used SFU reserves. I\'d take another class with him, he\'s so friendly!"

Chats all right, hard to hear, partly the system, also unclear speaking. Double negatives on final exam, but questions clear and fair on midterm.
