She made the material bad granted she is nice and kind of cool but her teaching style is bad. She needs help to teach I did well in her class but she barely makes sense to the point you laugh in class every week because its a waste of time avoidher"

The work is hard and she gets sidetracked very easily. She gave a group presentation project in a stats class. A STATS class. The only redeeming quality is that she allows a make up exam at the end of the semester, although it starts 10 min after the final."

I\'m not sure if these other people had the same Chellie I did, but mine was awesome. Yes, she gets sidetracked during class every now and then, but it\'s a stats class!

She made psych stats fun and I really enjoyed going to class. I took this over the summer and it was intensive, and she made it worthwhile. She gives amazing explanations and knows how to teach. If you are a lazy student, then she is not for you. Study hard and work hard you will do well. FAIR GRADER :)"

WAY TO DEMANDING OF HER STUDENTS. SHE HAS A 5 PAGE LENGTHY UNNECESSARY SYLLABUS. WAY TO MUCH WORK AND DOES NOT CARE FOR HER STUDENTS MUCH. NO WIGGLE ROOM AT ALL IN REGARD TO ANYTHING. SHE OVER-COMPLICATES AND OVERBURDENS STUDENTS IN A COURSE THATS DIFFICULT TO BEGIN WITH

She\'s pretty disorganized at times and gets side-tracked easily, but she\'s pretty lenient when need be. There\'s a bonus project and she does manage to find you points in the tests when you thought you bombed. She\'s really sweet, and idk if I would recommend, but she\'s chill. Give her a shot."

It is not a class you can just breeze through. If you stick with it, you will pass or maybe a B. She is very helpful and you had to make sure that you are proactive with her. Just stick with it and maybe she\'s give extra credit or curve the exams.."

You\'re going to have to work really hard because sitting in class you learn somewhat, but not enough to actually know what\'s going on. Disorganized and needs to give practice tests. Stop wasting class time talking about your life or random things. I study, but not it\'s not enough."

She taught the material well w/a passion. You need to come to class every day (b/c you *are* in college, not elementary school), write down *everything* she says, print out the lectures, understand everything, and *study* (i.e. memorize) them. Most students complain about her b/c they don\'t study."

She\'s so funny! BUT there is A LOT of material to cover & she moves FAST. You can\'t screw off. Her tests are from her lectures so PRINT her online lecture notes and fill them in during lectures.

She teaches the lesson in the last 10 minutes of class, and rambles on about her day for the first 1.5 hours. Her tests are very long, and she talks for the first 15 minutes of test days about things not relevant to the class/test (her commute, her dog, etc.), which wastes time. Would not recommend."

Worst Prof i have EVER had. Makes absolutely no sense at all and her test are IMPOSSIBLE. Even if she is the last prof on the planet and you must take this class find a way to avoid her.
