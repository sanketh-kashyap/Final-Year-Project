Not helpful in explaining assignments and lectures. I suggest not taking a class with her as she is awful at responding to emails and does not acknowledge her students when they ask for help!!! Did not like my experience in her research class. Class average was very low because she is a tough marker.

She makes everything interesting and is there for support when you need it.

She is fairly clear in her teaching and takes opinion of the class to heart. She has a good knowledge of sociology, and anything she doesn\'t know she looks up and finds for next class. Great Prof."
