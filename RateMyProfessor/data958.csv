Professor Schnee, is a good teacher and demanding, make sure you go to her class on time or she will mark you late. One dislike about her is that she throws shade towards students. I\'m not gonna lie i improved when it came to writing my essays. But you have to put in a lot of work to be better in something"

I feel she is a fair grader and she definitely gives second chances if you are late with work. She does everything step by step so it will be a benefit to you if you do all the work on time. She was very helpful and gave a lot of individual time to students.

Her main assigments about intelligence and racism made her class very interesting. she helped me with writings and explored thoughts. Her writing technics were helpful also.
