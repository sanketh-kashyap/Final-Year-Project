We had 4 speeches with very clear grading criteria. He tells us exactly what he expects from us in our speeches, offers a grading rubric, and gives great feedback. If you ask ahead of time, he is more than willing to help you prepare for a speech. I highly recommend him!"

He grades your speeches fairly and doesn\'t baby you about them. I.E if your speeches sucks, he will fail you. He gives two tests, which are completely bogus and most people fail them, but your speeches make up the vast majority of your grade. I can say that I definitely became a better speaker."

Overall, i would take his class again if i had to. His tests are ridiculous though. 3 tests - 100 questions each (on 6 chapter each?!) . Very confusing questions with long (full sentence) answers. When you do your speeches make sure you follow the structure and go by the outline and you will be fine. He is ok."

I had to take some time off for a family members funeral and he refused to comp the absences I was gone even though I had proof where I was. Also he would give me the wrong grade and I would have to go back and have him change it. I think he was just rude the entire semester and annoying.
