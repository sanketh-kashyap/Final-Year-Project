She never repeats what she says, she just goes on and on for an hour and a half and you have to follow as best as you can.

I would fall asleep sometimes, but only because because I commute and wake up at 4:30 every morning, NOT because she is dull. And for those of you whining about no/not enough slides, get over it!!

Prof. Davidson is the best prof I\'ve had this semester. She\'s engaging and extremely knowledgeable. Her material is interesting and goes way beyond information you may have picked up along the way. Her exams are fair and the topic for the paper was really unique. I\'ll look for her in the future!

Downside was there wasn\'t much about battles and war for a Europe - post 1945 class, but the social aspects we focused on were extremely interesting. Lots of reading, but it didn\'t matter that I didn\'t really do it, still got an A, very very helpful too! take a class with her!"
