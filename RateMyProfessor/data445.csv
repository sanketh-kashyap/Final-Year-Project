She takes points off for every little thing, and it\'s only a one credit course. Easy A assignments I\'ve gotten at least two points taken off so things such as wrong text color or not doing what she wanted the exact way she expected it."

She taught us as though we were second graders. She was also very demeaning to students, myself in particular, for expressing confusion in regards to her instructions. I would not recommend her to anyone."

The class consists of busy work with no application to the classroom. She is really lenient with due dates which helps.

This was an educational technology class and I felt as though she often did not know anything beyond what the textbook said. If you ask a question, she will answer it by poorly rephrasing the oricinally unclear assignment."
