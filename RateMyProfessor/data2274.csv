If you\'re looking for a specific answer, he\'ll dance around it most of the time. I would not recommend this class if you are not prepared to be stressed out 24/7 (he grades papers very hard). Be sure to speak up or it will hurt your grade in the end. No extra credit."

I do not recommend anyone to take his class if you\'re not ready to really push yourself! He assigns long papers almost every three weeks, and does a horrible job at preparing students for any assignment he gives! Worst class ever..."

But if you listen (closely) you will really learn some things. I took his study of authors: Octavia butler class and loved it. It wasn\'t easy and he will make you think critically.

A blast from the past! Kind and generous with grades... he\'s open to asking for extra time on assignments. Take his class for an interesting time...

I really like the teacher, but he can literally ramble for 3 hours. He knows what he\'s talking about - though he may not communicate it well. He is a tough grader, so you have to put some major thought into your essays and your test - but it isn\'t impossible. You can make up some points by the form reports during class."

He rambles a lot and isn\'t a very good lecturer, but he knows his stuff. It\'s easier to talk to him in his office hours and he\'s willing to help you and talk about the material. I would recommend him."
