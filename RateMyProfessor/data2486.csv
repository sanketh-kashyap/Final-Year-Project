He recommends to take research, Statistics, or analytical reasoning before Senior Seminar that\'s if your interested in Quantitative work. Usually the police officers don\'t like taking survey\'s. I like doing the qualitative part."

The only thing he asks is to show up to class because attendance is important. All there is to this class is going to class & do the assignment he assigns which is not difficult. In general, the class is interesting because he knows what he is talking about & take you will not regret it."
