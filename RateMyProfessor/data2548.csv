I\'ve had her for CABOT 102 and CABOT 103. If you don\'t pass its either you never show up, you dont understand directions and need to take English classes or you\'re the type of student who likes to argue with the teacher. Like seriously you must suck at every class if you can\'t pass hers."

The class is easy, just do the work. If you take up your assignments to her, she will correct it and you can basically fix it up until she loves it. The class was whatever, but it is not that hard. If you get on her good side, she\'s a wonderful person."

Even though English is my second language, she explains very clearly. She is funny and honest. She gives sample quiz which is directly related to final. Do homework and go to class, then you will be fine. She hates being late. Don\'t be late! I love her class so much!!!"

It seems to me she hates to come to class and somebody forces her to come and teach. I don\'t know what happened to that nice and easy lady.But still she is OK."

Go to class, pay attention half way, do the TWO assignments, take notes, do readings, get an A. It is that easy. You must go to class and take notes though. She has a lot of legal experience; the book the school uses is dumb. Things she says in her lectures will appear on the test. Useful class, Quality prof"

She is a wonderful, fun, helpful teacher. There is no reason why you won\'t get an A in her class if you do the work; she does not make it hard to get an A believe me. TAKE HER FOR ANY BUS CLASS!"
