For one of the presentations, he allowed me to bring my skateboard into class and show the students a few tricks. I thought this was great and so did the students. He is inspirational and smart. Also, he is a life coach!"

A few easy presentations and some small writing assignments and its an easy A. Makes people feel important. He will adjust to each individual student. Some issues he brings up could be controversial, so debates will happen, even if they seem a bit unorthodox."

The class was easy, but he taught us about preparing for the future in ways that relate to anyone\'s career or situation. Be careful about talking after class if you want to go home, he can chat for hours."

He is extremely calm and relaxed. He doesn\'t really teach the class, but ""guides"" the class along, letting the students teach themselves. He will also just tell you when homework is due JUST ONCE and then he will never remind you again! So make sure you keep yourself on track with all of your assignments!"
