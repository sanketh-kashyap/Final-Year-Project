She reads from her slides and randomly stops during the lecture. The slides are straight from the review at the end of each chapter in the textbook. Class was sooo boring."

She really doesnt explain things in detail. She also stops in the middle of the lesson to reread her notes and likes to jump around from topic to topic every few minutes. She seems nice but some of the things she says does not make sense. Considering the fact that i dont understand her it wasnt a pleasant class.
