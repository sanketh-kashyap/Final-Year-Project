Intro to Linguistics is no joke, don\'t take it just for GE. You need to buy the book, you use it every day. His lectures are straightforward and every slide is important, which is nice. His tests are VERY hard, but I managed to get an A in the class since he drops one test grade. If you like language, take this!!"

I may find the class a bit hard, but Jed just knows how to mdke it fun and somewhat understandable. I\'m currently taking Morphology with him, and once in a while, he lets us think ""dirty\'!"

He\'s really funny and pretty nice, but his tests are brutal and he is not as helpful as I would like. I don\'t recommend this class if you\'re taking it to fulfill a GE like me : ["
