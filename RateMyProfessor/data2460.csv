She cares more about how you understand, use the language & how you are comfortable using it (how to write/speak/grammar/etc) than grades (but you shouldn\'t miss class bc German is hard!) She gives good feedback and really wants us to learn German! Very good! I Recommend!"

If you are wanting an easy A with no homework do not take this class. This class is for people who genuinely want to speak and learn the structure of German. It is important you participate and that you do you HW!

She has a lot of energy in class and gets everyone engaged during class time! She places a lot of emphasis on participation so if you are looking to take a class and sit in the back and not talk / participate she isn\'t the right choice for you. If you want to be engaged in class then I highly recommend her.

I don\'t need to use hand motions for every verb that I learn nor do I need to write out 100 vocab cards per chapter, it\'s unnecessary and time consuming. She speaks too much English for being immersion and grades harshly."
