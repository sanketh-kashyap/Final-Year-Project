Yes, she can be nit-picky but generally it\'s when students aren\'t doing the homework and are AWOL for no good reason. In the end, my interest in Italian skyrocketed as I progressed through Beginner Italian I and II. Also, if I needed help, Professor Pisaturo was there to help"

TOUGH GRADER,1,1,"Please never take this professor for a language class. I was on track to take Beginning Italian 2 with her then move up to Intermediate Italian, and in a little over half of a semester completely disgusted me to the notion. Horrible professor, gives way too much online homework, and almost NO in class speaking! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!"

She is rude, nit-picky with every student (definitely picked on a few people more so than others) and an AWFUL teacher in general. There were never lectures. I do not recommend her if you want to enjoy learning Italian. I basically had to teach myself everything. Take it w Elisabetta!"

She didn\'t like me and made it quite obvious. She had favorites within the first week. Yelled at us for procrastinating even though we always all had hw done on time. Advice stay away from this class.
