If you are familiar with the material covered in class, go over the textbook, and write well, you will do well. He\'s extremely helpful in letting you know what will be on covered on tests and quizzes and designs the course in a manner that encourages you to do the work, learn, and want to come to class."

Its boring stuff but he makes class really interesting, i actually WANT to attend his class. Midterm and final are hard, an 82 was the highest grade in the class. Gives a single question quiz before every class to make sure you read the chapter prior to attending class."
