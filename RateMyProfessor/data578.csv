He has references to pop culture which makes it easier to understand. Overall it\'s not a difficult class. I am taking more classes with him.

I took pol sci twice in high school and got low B\'s each time. Prof. Dale makes it so clear and easy and is so willing to explain if you have any questions. He drops your lowest of 3 exams and almost always lets class out early.

I hated politics before taking his class, now I find them interesting. Very funny. Good teacher. Makes it easy to learn, hardly uses book. Lets us out of class early most days.

Great teacher funny but not on purpose. Don\'t need book just read notes every question on tests are in the notes. I wish he taught more classes!

He is very funny in class. I had him in a night class. You DON\'T need to buy the book if you don\'t want to. Just study your notes. All quizes and tests are on lecture. He let us out early almost every class. He is fair and also curves his tests. His exams are questions taken directly from quizes. Take this professor!
