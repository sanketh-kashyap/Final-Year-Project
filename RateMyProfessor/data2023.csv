Mr. Knox always goes the extra mile even if he doesn\'t know something he\'s not afraid to admit it but he will have the answer next time.

This is one of the reasons why I left Virgina College. The Instructors seem to laugh at me more than try to provide me with an education I deserve. Well, this was not the case with Mr. Knox. He immediately made me feel right at home. Mr. Knox thanks for helping me."

He\'s just a great teacher. Teachers like Mr. Knox don\'t come around to often. Very smart and charming fellow.

Their was never a time that I felt I coudn\'t raise my hand. He always said if anyone would laugh at a question, he would deduct points from them. That made me feel so comfortable because I knew he really had us at heart. All teachers should take notes from Mr. Knox. So young but yet so wise."

He never once took for granted that everyone knew how to use the computers. He broke everything down step by step. I had a lot of fun in his class and I already miss IT-100. To bad he\'s married. lol

Oh did I also mention he\'s handsome. .)
