It\'s really hard to get grades below a B with her unless you\'re hellbent on not trying. Just show up, participate, and do your work. The solo presentation will take a lot of effort, but she gives you explicit instructions so it\'s hard to go wrong."

She is very unclear with expectations and spends more time on activities than actually teaching the material, but expects you to know every detail on tests. Group project had ridiculously personalized expectations and she is unable to explain what she wants for a grade. Very rude in person and does not respond to emails."

It was a difficult."
