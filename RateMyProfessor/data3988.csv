Her lectures are long and slow but she knows what she is talking about and is a very personable instructor. Her tests are not hard as long as you know the material. Read the powerpoints and you will be just fine. She is very approachable, loves to tell stories, and loves to be included in small talk during break times!"

She is super helpful, responds to emails quickly, and is respectful. She really wants everyone to be a great nurse and does everything possible to help us understand the material. She told us upfront not to buy the book and her ppts are super helpful. Tests are hard because they are set up with NCLEX style questions so study!"
