Her lectures are long and boring, she does not explain Biology on a 1010 level at all. Quzzes and Tests very hard. Not too much homework. I went to class and tried to learn but really I feel like it was very unfair the level she was teaching at, we aren\'t Biology Scholars."

She preaches biology 1010 like it\'s biology 9090. She knows biology backwards and forwards, and expects students to know it just as well. Take good notes because thats all the help you\'ll get from her for test taking. I studied hard in this class and still got a B."

The majority of her teaching is through power points. Homework consists of reviews of Science articles as well as discussions in class about various subjects. I think she is a new instructor and is still figuring out how to best approach the teaching side of Biology. Tough class but I\'ve learned a lot.

She treats the class like little kids. She thinks she is so cool because she is a teacher. Her quizzes are hard but her tests are not terrible. She threatens a lot about how much you should study and rushes through the material. You can tell she\'s a new teacher

Tests are alot easier than she makes it seem. Study and you will do fine.
