Probably personally he is a down to earth nerd, unfortunately his congenial personality doesn\'t match his teaching. He is terrible at explaining material; it seems as if he himself doesn\'t really know and is kind of reassuring himself. It\'s easy to skip class because of how bad lecture is. DON\'T SKIP."

Also because I had a great TA that\'s great at explaining the material and made exams easy. Professor Burke is awesome though.

Just know how to do the HW and understand concepts.

Changes his mind about the concepts, makes mistakes all the time in lecture and wont let us use a calculator when we need to compute exponential values... Dont take this prof at all cost. he makes the ta lecture for him because he doesnt know the material himself. AVOID him."

Henry Lee is a much better teacher and I just started his class. Being scared of calculators because you believe people are going to cheat is crazy. It is a tool. He gets confused easily and relies on notes from other teachers. Do not take!

Around 30-40% of each test would be ridiculously hard while the rest would be pretty easy, but he grades straight scale (80%=A-,70%=B- etc) so getting a good grade is tough. Final had nothing to do with the material learned towards the end of class, very random"

This professor is seriously out to screw you over. He won\'t even tell you the format of the test or the main emphasis of it. And he doesn\'t curve. 19/78 people got C- or lower this quarter.
