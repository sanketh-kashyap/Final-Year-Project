She graded pretty hard at first, but near the end of the semester she seemed a lot more laid back about grading. The final few plays were actually super interesting and I enjoyed reading/watching them. The only downside is you have to see plays outside of class and they cost like $10 each."

If you are not naturally creative in the exact way she wants you to be, you will get harshly criticized. I felt very uncomfortable in this space and she never gave clear instructions."

The class is pretty easy as long as you do the readings and you can pretty much read spark notes and be fine. She also drops your lowest quiz grade (which shouldn\'t be below a 40/50).

Trimella created a creativepersonal safe-space for everyone in our class, which I really appreciated. She is very encouraging and an easy grader, take her if you can! Be prepared to write a short monologue and scene, as well as one or two other easy projects."

The tests are straight from the notes she gives you and she always has extra credit on each test. She is willing to be more than just a teacher. Loved this class! Definitely get her! She\'ll remind you of your grandma :)

The course itself was really fun and interesting. Very lax on homework assignments, but strict on attendance. Theres no tests and the final is a dance piece. You do have to keep an ""I book"" and attend some out of class events. It was my FAVORITE class of college."

Mrs. Chaney made it interesting, applicable, comfortable, and FUN! My favorite class I have ever taken! Mrs. Chaney is super nice and understanding, but there is still structure to the class. Best of both worlds; seriously!"

Tests are what are taught in class. Readings are short and easy, she goes over them in class as well. You do have to attend 2 plays but no paper is required. I would suggest taking this class for your core!"
