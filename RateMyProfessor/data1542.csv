No shortcuts for this class. I had him for orgo lab 1 & 2. One good thing about him is that he explains the entire lab procedure at the beginning of class. Honestly, he\'s not easy, but his grading is very clear. Just be aware this class will eat up 3-4 hours to write the prelab."

(1),13,01/06/2012,CHEM2511,2.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,1,I have never learned less in any class in College. He is seldom available to help in lab bc he is too busy eating or grading reports. He says that he wants you to learn on your own how to do the exp so he won\'t help you and then has the nerve to be strict on grading yields (he watches you weigh it). I learned zero and still got an A. He\'s a joke.

(1),13,02/02/2011,CHEM252,2.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I dropped his lab right away as soon as I walked out of the first lab. He checks the notebook and even if you do a good job he has some negative comment about it. He has to watch you weighing your product and then he reweighs the product after you leave. He is too big of a headache for one credit.

Study the lab textbook every week to prepare for pop quizes. I got an A, so its manageable. Nice guy who appreciates someone who offers to help him."

So long as you show up and keep your notebook in order you\'ll do well.

Because he had no idea though, he was very lenient. I can\'t say he\'d be this lenient for other semesters. If not, then, because of his lack of comprehension and because of his disorganization, it would be very tough to do well in his class."

He makes you come prepared but never knows anything and always has to ask another professor for help.AVOID HIM IF YOU CAN!!!!!
