Ashley  Gould,Boise State University,English department, Boise, ID,2,3.0,N/A,3.8,,12,03/23/2011,ENGL102,2.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Was unable to clarify many topics when asked in class. Had little understanding of formatting and citation (which is something she was teaching us in class).

This class is ALOT of work. She does attendance and takes points off if you miss days. If you can take another teacher for ENGL 102 that\'d probably be smart.

Her assignment description is a little lacking on the information and exactly what she wants. If you are struggling with a topic, meet with her and talk it out. She will watch you struggle and not offer her help, but if you get up and meet with her, then she\'s happy to."

The class challenges you and really does help you develop your skills, but as a teacher she is incredibly unreliable and often very unclear when giving help or explaining assignments. Her methods of grading are ridiculous to say the least, and there\'s simply too much work to squeeze into one semester."

She is helpful if you arrange a meeting with her, however, the assignments are unclear and there were a few instances that she did not show up to class without an email sent out before."

There is quite a bit of work; readings and responses. But the learning curve is incredible! Take this class from her if you are an English major, you will learn a TON. Otherwise it won\'t be worth the effort."
Ashley  Gould,Boise State University,English department, Boise, ID,2,3.0,N/A,3.8,,12,11/27/2009,ENGL102,2.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Ashley is a puzzle. She has a very laid back way of teaching but her grading is crazy. She marks you off for the smallest things and grades at a much higher level then the class is intended for. Ashley often says one thing and then will grade or revise her ideas 360 degrees. She is very confusing and unreliable. I would not recommend her.

I had to argue for a quarter credit. I should have taken this issue to the deans office because english 101 and 102 is supposed to be based on effort. Who gives a zero on an 8 page 5 source paper?! She just smiled at me as I was about to break down into tears. I got a B- in that class because of her"
