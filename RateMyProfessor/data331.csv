Takes sociological approach to teaching history. 2 midterms & final are all written examinations. Seems to grade them fairly easily. 8 hours of mandatory community service, which is easy b/c he always announces community service opportunities so you don\'t have to go find it yourself."

He has a passion for Mexican-American History and does an excellent job of ""tying-in"" the history to what is going on today. I am glad I took this class, as I learned so much about the relationships between Spain, Mexico (Latin America) and the USA; and learned a little bit more about myself."
