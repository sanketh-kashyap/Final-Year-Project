She gives plenty of time to finish assignments. This course was all online, which meant the labs part were excluded which I loved! She\'s a good professor and will answer any questions about any assignment."

Erin is overall full of energy in teaching, and invites her students to be interactive with one another and herself. She cares about her students, and goes above and beyond her job description."

This professor is clearly under qualified and professionalism is out the door. There is no use in trying to make an argument towards anything you think is unclear or plainly wrong. She expects to always be punctual yet she arrives late to class almost every day. Specializes in DISRESPECT

I got an A- in this class which was above the average, but I also put effort into emailing her about things i did not understand. The only flaws I found were the disorganization and sometimes the course material and format of testing could be confusing."

I turned in all my assignments on time and did all the required work with correct answers, but she would never give out an A. The class is hard and requires lots of time and work which you must be willing to do. The average grade in her class was a C."

This is not a easy A class you are going to have to put in your share of studying. The course content was good and she did teach us what we needed to know. Those that I see on here that gave a bad review of her must not have done their share.

The teacher can only do so much she has you for 50 min. a day thats not alot of time she cant cover everything. And for you people saying she doesnt know what your talking about how about you get up infront of 60 bratty college kids and teach this info :
