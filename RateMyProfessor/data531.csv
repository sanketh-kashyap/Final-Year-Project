No graded homework, just suggested problems, which you should do. Issue is there aren\'t always solutions to the problems so you don\'t know if you did them right, and the book is vague. Nice guy though, hoping to take later classes with him"

Material Science is tough but he curves everything a ton. Lab with him should actually be a fairly easy A because there isn\'t much for material you need to study for the tests and the 2nd half of the class is just papers.
