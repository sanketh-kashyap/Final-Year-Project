She gave did not give any guidance. If you don\'t know how to teach online... don\'t. I got 95%s and above in all of my other 300 and 400 level courses but only got an 88% in this 200 level course because she did not give any rubrics and then graded incredibly harsh. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. She ruined my 4.0.

She does not teach anything but rather draws diagrams and talks about them for every class. She is a nice professor but she does not teach. You must teach yourself and read the book, but even the book is not helpful. It is definitely not worth taking unless you are passionate about it."

WST 200 was the only class I never skipped because I enjoyed it. She is so sweet and she really cares about your success in her classes. Also, beecause of her I declared a women\'s studies minor. If you go to class everyday, take good/organized notes, and pay attention you\'ll be just fine!"
