I was really excited to take this class but I found myself wanting to skip it because it was so boring. Lots of people fell asleep. I can tell she knows her stuff but she seemed to have a hard time explaining it.

She often had to dumb material down & repeat herself for some students, which made the class go slowly. Her accent is noticeable but it never affected her teaching ability or my learning ability. She is very helpful if you have questions on the homework. Go to class, do the homework: easy A."

But kind of hard to understand, english isn\'t her first language. She\'s really intelligent but can\'t always spell words and i guess, it may just be my own fault, but hard for me to understand."
