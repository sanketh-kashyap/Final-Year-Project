I was in the HOSPITAL during his exam, and when I asked for a retake he didn\'t even respond. I had to get the Dean of Engineering involved, and then he responded and said no. I got NC for the class because of him. WORST PROFESSOR AT STONY BROOK!"

Pay attention to EVERYTHING he says and take notes. I got 32 points above the average on his part.

Maybe if he was a little more engaging and less insulting, more people would come to class. Mult. choice with more than 1 correct is BS, I did better on the essays."
