Very unhelpful. Do not take as a summer class with him. When I asked for help on an exam he just told to go back and sit down and think about it some more. I wasn\'t even asking for the answer, just direction. Completely unwilling to help his students with their concerns. Run away, fast!"

It was hard to get up and get there but the class was not hard and Dr.Kelly gives great lectures. He brings in all these gadgets to better demonstrate. He is sweet and funny and I hope he teaches longer (even though he\'s in his 60\'s)

He has a good sense of humor and has a very structured class environment. You know when things are due and when test will be and what will be on them. It was very enjoyable and I would take any class he teaches. Tip for those who do. DO THE READINGS."

Very clear and doesn\'t expect too much from you as long as you show up. The class is pretty easy (he realizes that the class, for most, is a university requirement), as long as you\'re not stupid."
