His lectures go on for ages, and deviate so far from the curriculum and level of 2nd year students that it\'s hardly worth it to sit through them. Read the textbook instead. If you ask him for assistance, don\'t expect him to be helpful, or polite. It\'s difficult to believe all these positive ratings, to be honest."
