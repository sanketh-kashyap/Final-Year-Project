Lauren  Enright,Portland Community College,Emergency Medical Services department, Portland, OR,1,4.3,N/A,3.2,,6,01/08/2010,EMT105,4.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Amazing teacher. No **** lady. If you are looking for someone to coddle you through EMS training (and I hope you aren\'t) steer clear of her! She is tough and disciplined. As good as a teacher can get for EMS training.

Anyone who says she is mean prbly deserved her wrath.Don\'t go to this class expecting to be able to be late or use your phone or sleep there. WE LOVE HER... still!!! passed all tests and miss class A LOT"

She\'s got it down and knows how to connect with her students. At times she may seem mean. But thats just because some immaturity is present and people don\'t relize how serious this class is. She can get you to know her stuff and will make sure you succeed all you have to do is bring a will and maybe your brain

Take the class from someone who will not make you feel bad about asking simple questions.

This is NOT writing 121 or some other class. This class will teach you how to save people. If you actually study, you will do well. If not, dont work with me. Lauren is an amazing, no BS type of teacher. Take her if you want to learn about becoming an EMT!"
