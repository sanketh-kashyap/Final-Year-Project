She\'s fair and friendly and comfortable to be around, enough to admit you don\'t know what you\'re doing or if you made a mistake in lab. I recommend her for General Biology Lab over the other instructors."

Quizzes could be a bit hard, but she graded fairly. Learned a lot in that lab!"

She has tons of typos in her homework assignments which are graded ambiguously. Nice person though once you get to know her. Study on your own since she won\'t tell you what she\'s specifically looking for.

Don\'t even waste your time. If you want a really good professor that won\'t mark you off for having your shoes untied, go with Kristen Kimble. Much better professor and much less of a headache."

She is very helpful and she\'s ecouraged you to be better. Her quiz style is very clear and challenged. If you study hard, then you will do fine."
