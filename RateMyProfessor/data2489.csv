She makes it easy for non-art majors like me. Very personable and great person. Ceramics were very fun although in the beginning it\'s scary cuz you don\'t know what you\'re doing but at the end I was sad it was over. You do have to come in extra to get your work done but it\'s so laid back it\'s cool. And you get art to take hom

I\'m and art major but it wouldn?t matter if you were or not. Great instructor, great advisor, positively wants you to pass and develop as an artist. The finest class I?ve had, to open your eyes to make sure to register early because Ohm?s class rapidly."
