Pay attention in class and read the powerpoints. Don\'t get overwhelmed with the Pharm exam it is difficult if you over study. My advise is to study meds by systems. Read the chapters before studying the powerpoint but he is very clear and concise. You will be fine.

He seems to just not care and there just for a paycheck. If I had a choice on instructors, would be at the bottom of my list. But its Nursing School - don\'t have a choice of instructors."
