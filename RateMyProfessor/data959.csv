Throughout the semester, you are required to complete presentations, papers, quizzes, and discussions at random times. Even worse, I didn\'t receive a single grade on an assignment all semester. Your final grade will be a complete surprise."

Her grading gets progressively harder through the semester on written work. She is pretty cool and brought her cute kindergarden daughter sometimes. She is good at teaching but gets frustrated when people can\'t do stuff well.

She\'s Cuban but her english is fun. Her accent is great and she tells a lot about her interesting life. She prepares you very well for tests and grades pretty easily on writing and orals. She even cuts out a lot of tests if she things it is too much. Great TA. Fun class.
