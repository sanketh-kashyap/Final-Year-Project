She knows the course material, is fair with assignments, and is very good at teaching. Every class you sit in you will learn something new. There are in class assignments, so if you miss a class you get a 0% for it and it can\'t be made up, even with a valid excuse. Everything else you learn in class and work at home."

Tech savey or not, you will learn a thing or two in her class. She allows for homework days in class so students can get good grades and have her there to help hands on. If you are a quick study she wont waste your time either. Highly recommend, the book is very helpful, but you can get by sharing one with a friend."

LOTS OF HOMEWORK  GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK,1,0,I absolutely LOVE Betti! Reading textbook definitions/instructions + asking for help when needed is highly suggested. You can\'t learn if you don\'t make it to class! Homeworks may take time but are graded and very similar to the computer portion of tests. Went above to make sure our class passed tests. Would take my entire college career with Betti.

She rises above the general dullness of the course material, to present a course from which everyone could benefit. Betti is very pleasant, although the course itself is surprisingly challenging to those who have not had much exposure to the software itself. Highly recommended!"
