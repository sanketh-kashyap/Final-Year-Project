Katherine  Schroeder,Modesto Junior College,Biology department, Modesto, CA,3,2.3,N/A,3.2,,6,04/25/2012,BIO111,2.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"I personally didn\'t like her teaching style. She would show us slides and then say ""oh you don\'t need to know this for the test"" after I had just written a paragraph. She\'s very nice though and labs are interesting."

Attendance is mandatory, but with attendance and good note taking you should be successful. If I hadn\'t missed some classes I would have gotten an A."

I have an overall gpa of 3.8 and I got a D in her class! Can\'t answer anyone\'s questions reguarding her own field. I don\'t think she understands biology at all! Tells you to not take notes in class and just listen? Tests arent easy and she is not clear at all!

She might be a good person, but is a horrible teacher! Does not give any analogies or examples to remember the material, only teaches straight out of the text book. Even then, her lectures confuse you regarding the actual material given in the book. I felt like going to her lectures confused me more than just reading the book"

She teaches straight from the book, no originality whatsoever, one chapter a day - gives you 4 ""midterms"" with 8 chapters each with a scantron. If you ask her a question that isn\'t in the book, she says ""What does the book say?"" or ""We aren\'t going to be going over that, I think. I\'m not sure."" Unorganized and often tardy."

She is very easy with grading. As far as extra credit goes, she gives it a lot. It was her fist time teaching a bio class, and I think she did a great job. Our labs were wack, not her fault, though. Other than that, she is recommended!"
