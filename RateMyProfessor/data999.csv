However, her classes are not extremely structured, and she does not give great feedback. She is very passive and consigns to the ""there is no wrong answer"" mindset. Students with lack of experience communicating in work settings need good constructive feedback to grow. Overall not a bad professor, uses a great book for class."

We did a lot of exercises related to lecture, which helped us to better understand the material. We did a lot of group work and a speech. I was not worried to do my speech in this class as I was in other ones. I can say it was the best speech that I prepared in all my college years. The professor was very friendly."

She was very straight forward and the material was easily comprehensive. Show up and you will pass the class (work is required).

It\'s such an easy class and she makes it seem so hard. CSULA needs give this professor a mental evaluation. Her class has no structure and she is not encouraging at all. Walking into her class is like walking into a funeral."

Her teaching somewhat goes contrary to the text and she piles on tons of work. Her sylabus is unclear and does not list all of the coursework concisely. She acts as though she has some phycological issues.

I had this type of course in a different college which was twice as hard and got an ""A"" there. I dont feel I learned anything new in this course. Would not recomend this proffesor. She will s..w your GPA in no time (maybe she enjoys doing that)..."
