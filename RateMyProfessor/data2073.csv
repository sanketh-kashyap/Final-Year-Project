She let me take an exam about a week after it was given. I never read for class and got a B-. It\'s pretty much one of those classes where if you just go and study for an hour, you\'ll be fine."

TAKE IT"

Slow at times with some boring lectures (maps, subway systems, etc) and great lectures (video/board games, comics, gang series). Fell asleep every class and got a B-. Tests have 10 keywords but you need to study about 40 keywords. Workshop assignments and attendance are great grade boosters. Gives extra credit!"

It would definitely help to read, but I don\'t. I got a C on my first test. She gives extra credit opportunities so that helps a little. She\'s very nice and also extremely helpful. Take notes and read if you can, but you can get by without reading as long as you go to class."
