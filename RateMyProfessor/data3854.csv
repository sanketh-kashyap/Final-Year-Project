Victor  Hayamave,University of Central Florida,Engineering department, Orlando, FL,0,4.5,N/A,2.0,LOTS OF HOMEWORK (1)  GROUP PROJECTS (1)  Gives good feedback (1),1,08/17/2015,EML4024C,4.5,2.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,LOTS OF HOMEWORK  GROUP PROJECTS  GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK,0,0,"Taking Victor for Solidworks class in the Summer was not too bad of an experience. While he doesn\'t take attendance, it is smart to show up on the day he decides to. The book is not really needed, and most everything you should know is explained in class. Overall, do the HW sketches as shown and remember to constrain and you won\'t have an issue."
