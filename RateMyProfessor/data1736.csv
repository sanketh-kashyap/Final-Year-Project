Most of the questions are not from the book or examples presented in lecture. I did not finish this course yet but the latest average for the second exam was a 40%. In my opinion, you would be safe choosing a different professor for Calculus 2 (152)"

Representative upper level math course. Difficult, but with effort, you can get it. She really wants us to do well and puts in effort to help. Plus it\'s pretty cool to be taught by a 20-something year old chick than an old, stuffy man who barely speaks English. The accent rocks, I can hear it in my sleep."

Her tests are really hard, but the curve is very generous and the grading is very fair. (i.e A is like 77 and B+ is like 70 an so on)Take her."

One of the few women who are gifted with beauty and intelligence. However, she lacks compassion, especially, for non-math majors."
