He\'s one of those people who is really good at telling stories which is really important in a class like this. He is incredible at teaching and he\'s hilarious too. I wish I could take him again. Lecture wasn\'t always necessary to attend but I went anyways, because I never wanted to miss out on one."

Anything in the book and in class is fair game for the test, so as long as you keep track of that you can study ahead. Otherwise he doesn\'t post images to study until a week before the test. It\'s a lot to study but if you work hard you can get an A. Tough grader, but there\'s no hw (1 paper) and you almost don\'t need the book at all"

Aside from knowing everything about every period, style, and artist, his insight is astonishing and to be perfectly honest, inspiring. Be warned though, he has very high expectations. Think outside the box with papers and participation. He respects that the most."

He expects superior writing for capstone. His laid back approach to teaching has a purpose, but your approach has to be intense to ace the course.

And maybe it\'s just me, but I find it next to impossible to receive an A in this man\'s class. Awesome atmosphere and you will learn a ton, but if you plan on continuing school after undergraduate, be prepared to have the GPA tank a little. And by that I mean a B. Or C."

Very approachable, talented teacher, knows everything and can make anything interesting. Capstone with him was my easiest Art History class by far.
