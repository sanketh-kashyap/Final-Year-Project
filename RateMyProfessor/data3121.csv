I managed to get an A on the final. Group assignment was fun. However, she was hands down the best part about this course- her passion is contagious. Take her!!"

Yes, Prof. Tessier is sweet and extremely passionate. I cannot say that this class was eye-opening--it focused on the obvious, unlike some of my friends\' SPED 301 courses. Memorize the acronyms, complete project requirements, and you\'ll be fine grade-wise. Participate and she\'ll love you."
