There\'s an attendance policy but since she posts everything in class online there\'s no point in going, especially since the class is so boring you\'ll probably fall asleep anyway."

But the homework and tests/quizzes are easy. She has her powerpoints on Angel so that you can study from those. Most difficult thing about this class is finding the will power to go. Good professor, just not the most exciting."

Lecture notes were posted online, homework assignments covered relevant material, and she devoted large amounts of class time to reviewing homework assignments. It is true that her lectures can get dull, mainly because she spends so much time reviewing since so many students are apathetic."

Her tests were very hard. She asked every five minutes if anyone had any questions, but wasn\'t very helpful. Almost everyone didn\'t have a clue what was going on, including me!"

Not helpful at all, runs through things like we\'re all economists...and it\'s a 100 level course!!! Hard to understand because she talks too soft. Don\'t take her class unless absolutley needed!!"
