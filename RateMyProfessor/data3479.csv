Abi  Nubla-King,Western Washington University,Education department, Bellingham, WA,0,1.0,N/A,5.0,,2,02/08/2009,SPED484,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"WWU Seattle Branch...This is the worst class I have ever had! The teacher is horrible and does not know the material (she\'s reading 1 chapter ahead of the class). Also, the work load is too high with tedious assingments that ask for repeative rationales even though the material isn\'t taught 1st. Worst yet, the teacher is rude to the students!!!!"
