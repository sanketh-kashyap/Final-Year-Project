He\'ll leave most of the work up to you, if you really want to learn the stuff you will have to read it on your own. His lectures are fun but don\'t go by the book much. His tests are easy. Very nice guy and is willing to help if you ask for it."

You barely have to do any work whatsoever. Didn\'t learn jack but aced this class no problem. His tests only cover one small, simply topic from his lectures. VERY SIMPLE take it for easy A now!"

I went into this class wanting to learn. I am completely disappointed. I paid good money and he showed up for class 10 minutes everyday and left. It was pure laziness but no one complains because its THE EASIEST A in the whole world. Dont take him if you want to learn anything about Excel, Word, or Access"
