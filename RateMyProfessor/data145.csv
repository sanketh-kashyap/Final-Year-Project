He\'s a great teacher. He\'s helpful, which is nice, because the essays aren\'t exactly easy if you haven\'t been taught the college way to write. Effort and commitment go a long way though. The class feels like a community too. I just really loved his class."

Really cares, even if he knows the subject/SI class sucks. Very entertaining as well.. definitely the most enjoyable class I had this semester. Only side note is that he grades pretty difficult, but you can still get a good grade if you participate and do extra on the small stuff. Barely any reading. Great class!"
