I took Intro to Teaching online. You have to do 30 hours of observation in one classroom as well as two service projects and other homework. If you haven\'t taken Ms. Vaughan in class I wouldn\'t recommend starting out taking her online. She is much better at explaining in person.

In this class you have to do 6 hrs of observations but if you ever need help she will help you! She used to be a kindergarten teacher and principal so she knows what she\'s talking about!

She does have favorites, but really she just expects you to do your work and follow her rules for observations. Homework is super easy. Observations just require you to go to the school, observe correctly, and present it. Have confidence! :)"

If you can\'t afford a book, you better make friends with someone in your class so you can do homework and read in class. There\'s a lot of nonsense work, but what she teaches is relavent and you\'ll remember it!"

She expects a lot from her students, but if you are serious about becoming a teacher, this is the class to take. You will learn a lot. She gives a ton of homework and you will have observations, so be ready to work. I would not suggest taking more than one of her classes at a time. You WILL need a book!"

Yes, she does expect a lot, but if you keep up with the work, there is no reason you shouldn\'t get an A or a B. I wouldn\'t recommend taking more than 1 or 2 of her classes per semester. She loves her job and her students, and she\'s very passionate about teaching! I don\'t regret taking her classes one bit."
