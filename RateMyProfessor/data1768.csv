Devon  Powers,Drexel University,Communication department, Philadelphia, PA,6,2.8,N/A,3.8,Tough Grader (1)  Participation matters (1),5,12/01/2015,COM101,2.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,C-,PARTICIPATION MATTERS  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"While she is a very energetic professor, her class was beyond boring. It basically only consisted of powerpoint slideshows and badly written news articles on emojis. A very tough grader for no reason; she would comment that an essay was ""very well written with a clear focus"" and leave no negative feedback but would grade it as a C+."

You think your doing well and everything is ok and out of nowhere you get a bad grade. She grades super hard and if you miss a lot of classes your screwed. Not the worst at Drexel but certainly one of the worst in the communications department. Avoid her if you can.

Her classes were very interactive and never boring. Her exams were not difficult if you paid attention in class. I never open the book and I was still able to get Hundreds on all the exams.

WHEN I EMAILED HER WORRYING ABOUT MY GRADE BECAUSE I HAD WANTED AN A FOR THE CLASS. SHE EMAILED ME BACK SAYING DON\'T WORRY ABOUT IT, IT\'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD."
