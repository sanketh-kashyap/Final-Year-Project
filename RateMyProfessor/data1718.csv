Paul  Cutrufello,University of Scranton,Science department, Scranton, PA,8,3.4,N/A,3.0,Skip class? You won\'t pass.

Quizzes and exams are challenging. Exam questions are pretty tricky. Lots of little assignments that are worth 1% which can be annoying. The best way to do well in the class is to take good notes and ask questions."

I wish I had taken him than profesor Brelof.

He definitely favors some of the students. Unfortunately, I have to take him again."

He can sometimes favor athletes so beware and always study for pop quizzes he can pop them in anywhere."

If you take his class you\'ll pass but your grade depends on how much he likes you.

He tries his best to reach his students & help them in any way he can, so he gets frustrated when kids don\'t seem to care about the class. Tests are not bad as long as you study.. nothing tricky just straight up muscles, origins, insertions, etc. Would definitely recommend him to anyone."
