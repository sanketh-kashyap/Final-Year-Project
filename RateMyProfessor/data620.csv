I sent him an email to clarify something, but he just emailed back saying I was wasting his time and explained in a sarcastic way that it was an unnecessary email. He spent so much time saying this that he failed to even answer my short yes or no question. Such an unprofessional teacher."

I got an A in his class but I went through hell. He does not know how to talk to his students. Took his online class and i had to figure everything out myself. He did not grade the papers that i gave him in the beginning of the semester until last couple of weeks of the class...no feed back or anything.

Assignments and quizzes are straight forward, but definitely has an attitude problem. Very unprofessional person, insults students and never wants to help students. LPC deserves better, he doesn\'t deserve to teach nor belong here. Considers students contacting him about grades as ""harassing him."" Don\'t waste your time."
