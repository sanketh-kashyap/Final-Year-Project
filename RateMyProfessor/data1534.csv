This is a PhD level class and he does not spoon feed the students which, is obviously what others are expecting. If you pay attention, take some initiative to do what is expected, you will come out a better researcher and will appreciate the knowledge with which he has provided."

When you go his office he treats you with disrespect. He is rude , and arrogant and only cares about his title of assistant dean."
