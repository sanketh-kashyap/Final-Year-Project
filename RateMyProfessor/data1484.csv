CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA  GRADED BY FEW THINGS,1,0,"Took as a gened, was a little hard for an entry-level class with a lot of memorization, but overall interesting. Attendance is only mandatory for weekly labs. Her slides are good, but she doesn\'t put them online, so you have to go to lecture. Grade is composed of weekly labs, midterm, 2 shorts papers, & final. Interesting prof & passionate."

YOU WON\'T PASS.  LECTURE HEAVY,1,0,By far worst teacher I\'ve had. She is very nice but makes it so you have to go to every class because she does not post the powerpoint online. She makes grading incredibly hard and requires you to do 2 big projects for her that are very hard. Just do not take this class

Needs constant assistance from other professors on lab prep and instruction. Zero help when asking for guidance in labs. Quiz question are not found in the readings or notes as stated"

The midterm average was ridiculously low and she called a 1 point scale generous -- 89 is an A- whoa thats crazy. Most of the TAs aren\'t good, so do yourself a favor and save your GPA and take another class."

But the midterm and final are SUPER HARD. She tests you on stuff never discussed in class or the book. Discussion is 30% of grade and TA\'s suck soooo... Overall disapointed

The content is really interesting but the professor doens\'t follow the sillabus (more work than it says there) neither the textbook (she teaches the oposite theories).
