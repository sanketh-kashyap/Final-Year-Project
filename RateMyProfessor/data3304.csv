I really enjoyed it, there is a lot of discussion. Dr. Mize-Smith was really good teacher and one of my favorite classes I have taken but we also had a really good group of people that made the discussions interesting."

Assignments range from making LinkedIn profiles to giving your own presentation based on the reading material. There was no textbook; just documents available on BlackBoard to read before class! Classroom setup is very based on participation."

It was tough, but in the end it was worthwhile because i came out as a much better communicator. There isn\'t many tests, but the ones that is given are pretty difficult. But as long as you show up and participate you should be fine."

She tries really hard to keep class interesting and she\'s very nice. She\'s typically an easy grader on both the tests and presentations. Just put some effort into the class and you\'ll do great! Everyone found her final group project to be confusing, but in the end we still got an A anyways."

The majority of your grade is done in groups and if one person screws up, the whole groups suffers. She refuses to consider this in grades and allows for students to get a higher grade than they deserve while screwing over others."

Her Group descion making class is a lot of work, but it is all worth it. It is one of the only classes I have had that we actually get to use the knowledge we are taught. She is willing to help as much as you need it. The material is easy, you just have to apply it. I do highly recommend her!"

The courses she teaches are upper-levels, so the content is difficult, but she\'s all about trying to get the material across to you. She\'s good about putting assignments in besides exams, so that your overall grade has sum depth to it, n\' not just made up of 3 exams; 1 slip n\' ur done. Overall great professor!"
