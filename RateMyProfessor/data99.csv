She\'s really helpful and all of the assignments are clearly written out at the beginning of the semester. It\'s a work-at-your-own-pace kind of class and then it\'s easier than taking online. Would definitely recommend.

We had discussions which were an easy 100 as long as you know what you\'re talking about & don\'t have many grammatical errors. The homework is not that hard & you get two attempts to take the quizzes.
