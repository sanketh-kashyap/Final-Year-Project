Nancy  Weston,University of California Berkeley,Rhetoric department, Berkeley, CA,5,3.8,N/A,4.2,,10,01/29/2014,RHETOR160,4.5,4.0,Mandatory,N/A,N/A,A,,3,3,"Weston invites her students to think. She will not make it easy, because it is not easy. But she cares and she cares quite a bit. Do not be scared of her. Weston is the best professor I\'ve ever had, she will teach you, and not just teach you as in you learn a few new details about Kant or Heidegger, but teach you as in you will see the world."

She transformed the way I think and take in the world. She is an apostle of sorts -- I will never forget her or the impact she has made on my life.

She is committed to her students in a way I had never seen before, and a true lover of the material discussed. Very challenging class, life altering. Attend to the matter at hand."

I occassionally google her to confirm she\'s still teaching and recall my college experience, because she largely defined it. Her class changed my life. She taught me how to think and see the world. She is the most challenging professor I ever had (including grad school) but the best."

Weston is a little terrifying in class, but great in office hours and meetings; she genuinely wants to help, but she demands you do the work to actually learn. This class was not a pleasant experience for me, but it changed the way I see and experience the world."

She will challenge you, yes, blatently by saying you\'re wrong until you don\'t even want to speak. Then you are ""thinking"". Good for quite people and those who like authority."

Weston challenges student?s to question the fundamental commitments of our age, not just to dress them up in trendy prose. For those with the patience and imagination required for such an undertaking, the class is immensely rewarding."
Nancy  Weston,University of California Berkeley,Rhetoric department, Berkeley, CA,5,3.8,N/A,4.2,,10,12/11/2010,RHETO167,4.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,1,"This course is not easy, but good courses rarely are. The instructor is intimidating. She will take issue with the inexactitud of your words. But if you suspend the rhetoric student\'s need to say clever things and use stale arguments/ways of speaking, if you LISTEN, you will find peace with her and learn. Best class I took in department."

You will bond with her, you will laugh, you will cry, but at the end of the day she won\'t help you out as her only duty is ""to make herself obsolete."" This class changed my life; my outlook on the way the world functions, and how we fit into its metaphysical framework. Great class, not for the faint of heart. Also: READ."

She struck me as impolite and ready to pounce on those brave enough to share. Very shrill."
