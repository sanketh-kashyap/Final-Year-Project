Always responds to emails. Had a proctoring issue and he answered immediately. The only criticism I have is he sits on weekly assignments for a week or two. But he does provide feedback. No major papers just proctored tests. I would take him again.

Lectures were interesting, and teaching method was very professional and practical. While some people found the class difficult, it is actually fairly easy if you apply yourself and study."
