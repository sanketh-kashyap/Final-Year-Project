I understand that she picks out content like George Carlin speeches to hold the classes interest but really let\'s read some Camus or something.

She doesn\'t explain well on what she expected. Intense homework are given out in 8 weeks of summer class. If you really love writing, recommend to take her, otherwise... you will suffer like i do."

She is extremely fair and the only worry you should have is making sure you show up. Attendance is key. Loved her class."
