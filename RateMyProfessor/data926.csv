I missed a few class sessions and got a B. She really wants to see you put in an effort to talk about what she talks about. She talks about real life stuff. What we talk about in the classroom stays in the classroom. I did learn but you teach yourself. RECOMMENDED.

Relates psy to everyday life and teaches from that perspective. Great class.

She does use a different approach to teaching, but its one that uses a lot of student interaction and expression. Her thoughts can be jumbled at times so you need to pay attention but as long as you show up and participated in class and do your homework you should get an A no problem!"
