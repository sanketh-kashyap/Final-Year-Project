He has a very unique approach, he explains the same concept in multiple ways so that it appeals to whichever way that you learn best. HE IS THE BEST!!!!!!! ask around and you will see........"

I had him as my workshop leader for chem 103 and he was amazing. He explains really well and really goes out of his way, and tries his best to see that you understand the material. Every student who gets into his workshop class should consider themselves very lucky."
