I was nervous at first but she turned out to be great. I guess the student with the negative comment was one with an F on his/her transcript. If you do the work, it is an easy A."

On her lectures all she does is read the outline and if u ask her a question she will just continue reading and will not answer your questions. She also failed everyone even the A students. They took her off the campus and now she is teaching at another campus. Dont take her!!!!!!
