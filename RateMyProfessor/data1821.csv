I mean that. If she could be president of the University or of the United States we would all be better off. She is brilliant, relevant, hilarious, and understanding. Shes exactly what a college professor ought to be. A national treasure. Take any of her classes - you will not be disappointed."

She is the sweetest thing and cares so much about her students. Lots of lectures but she makes them engaging and funny. Really knows her stuff! Takes attendance at the beginning of the semester but was more lenient toward the end. I enjoyed her class so much that I am taking her again this semester.

She is so caring and its obvious she loves what she does. Be prepared to read! You read a lot in the class but she makes her lectures engaging. She is somewhat of a hard grader on papers but gives you a chance to resubmit for a better grade. SO sweet! I highly recommend.

I\'m currently taking her class but I decided to rate anyway. She is extremely knowledgable on the middle ages and lectures in a manner that you can understand and enjoy. Not the easiest I\'ve ever had but she is fair. UofL has a gem and probably won\'t be able to replace this one.

LECTURE HEAVY,3,2,"Professor Wise is a nice woman, but she is a horrible teacher. Her lectures made me want to die. They are so dull and lifeless. Shakespeare is already pretty dry, but somehow she finds a way to make it worse. I would never take her again. Her classes are mandatory which stinks because her lectures drag on and seem to never end. I regret this class!"

Adorable, passionate, and offers extensions and help in any way she can."

I knew nothing about Shakespeare going in but she teaches class like she\'s telling a story. She gives fun facts and jokes and really makes the class interesting.
