She\'s very passionate about it and you have to work hard to really understand and get a good grade, but it\'s worth it in the end. She is very reasonable and nothing on the quiz/test is unexpected. LOVED IT!"

She\'s an ok prof, but not the best. She\'s a native speaker, a reasonable teacher, and a fair grader. but she can be very grumpy sometimes. not exactly the warm and cuddly type. She doesn\'t use blackboard at all. if you study and have good attendance, youll get an A. mediocre attendance equals a B."

The language and alphabet might be intimidating at first, but the teacher really enforces and drills it well. You do have to work and study a lot, it may be challenging but worth it when you finally get to reading Russian :) She is a fair teacher- that\'s what counts.."
