Karen  Beck,Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,Spanish department, Indianapolis, IN,4,2.5,N/A,3.7,,3,03/05/2014,SPANS132,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,Teacher won\'t speak english or won\'t allow us to talk in English in a second semester Spanish 100 level. She sets students up to fail and gets her thrills being in charge. Only sits in a chair or at her desk. Only has written on the board twice. Wrong that she enjoys seeing students fail. Worst class and teaching ever. Worst mistake to take class.

Students only allowed to ask questions in Spanish which created an atmosphere of resentment and confusion. Students go without the full benefit of completely understanding the principles found in learning Spanish. This lowered grade and GPA."
