Explains everything well, very helpful if you need it, and is very reasonable with grading and homework. Probably the best physics prof. you will find at this school."

Pretty fair, kind of a push-over. Grading is fair and not too much homework. Very smart but, not good at teaching at all but overall not that bad of a teacher."

Sort of awkward, but in a way that is somewhat inviting for people that need extra help. Probably one of the most lax professors I\'ve had yet. Homework is mostly all on Webassign, and the labs are usually simple, just don\'t miss any (he will deduct significantly)"
