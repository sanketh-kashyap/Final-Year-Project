Almost felt more like we were hanging out than having class. He is very inspiring and has interesting opinions on teaching. If you can get his class--take it. You\'ll get an A if you show up and participate in discussions."

I really learned some things I\'ll be able to use in the classroom. I encourage anyone at UA who is in Social Scince Ed to take Dr. Lovorn.
