Rebecca  Turner,Savannah College of Art and Design,Art History department, Atlanta, GA,0,4.0,N/A,4.0,LECTURE HEAVY (1)  Tough Grader (1)  Get ready to read (1),1,08/22/2017,ARTH282,4.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,No,C+,GET READY TO READ  LECTURE HEAVY  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,She\'s very kind but very invested in art history! Don\'t take this for an easy A unless you\'re a wizard at church-architecture. I\'ve never gotten less than a B in an art history class until this class. She helps prepare you for her quizzes but covers just about the entire textbook. If you aren\'t majoring/minoring in ARTH don\'t take her class..
