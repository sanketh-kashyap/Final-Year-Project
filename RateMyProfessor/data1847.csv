Of course, it\'s good policy to have certain amount of reserve, too much reserve lowers citizen\'s living condition and too little reserves mean you will be at the mercy of a poor global economy."

Business = selling and making money, so it\'s a great class to learn how to market products. One of the more stimulating class I have had.

But you really need to read the textbook to get an A. A lot of her slides don\'t explain what the terms mean. She talks very fast, so it\'s hard to keep up sometimes, but leaving 1 hour early in the summer everyday is cool. Read the book and it\'s an easy A."

No way you won\'t get an A unless you\'re a total slacker. Got a 98 and 100 on the exams by just filling in her review sheets from her ppt notes & the textbook and reading them over at work during the day. Really cares about students! She even brought chocolate for us
