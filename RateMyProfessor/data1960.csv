Go visit him in office hours and just talk with him. He loves people and he is a wonderful person to get to know. If you take the time to get to know him, he will not let you walk away with anything but an A and will make sure you succeed!

Stewart is the best teacher and isn\'t concerned too much about grades, tests, etc. He wants his students to really enjoy black music in the same context that he does and focuses on that. Tests and quizzes are all super easy. He even tells you what is going to be on the tests. Class also always gets out early."

No PPs, have to look up 50% of lecture in book to clarify. Seemingly unimportant lecture was on test but not in book. After 5 hrs of study don\'t bother cause it won\'t help grade, just hope your notes captured enough"

Probably as easy as an elementary school class. There is no need for the book and he tells you exactly what questions will be on the midterm and final, so you just have to memorize those answers. Easier than Dance 45 or Music 15 or really any other GE that fulfills an art requirement."

Unless you already know a lot about Blues, Gospel, R&B, Ragtime, Soul, ect. don\'t take this class. The only plus some people may prefer is he doesn\'t keep attendance but I don\'t recommend missing a single lecture."

Laid back class, we just listened to jazz and classical music. Went on tangents about his life between music scores. Always kept the class laughing. Multiple choice and true/false tests.

His tests were completely unfair and he did not prepare students at all for what he expected them to know. The class had no structure and lecture was a complete waste of time. The TA (Richard Meghoo) is a completely worthless teaching assistant, he made the class 100% more difficult."

His lectures are interesting, he plays lots of music to illustrate what he is talking about (and when there aren\'t recordings he sings haha).
