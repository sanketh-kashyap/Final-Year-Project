I dunno what\'s up w/bad reviews, taking her online class is awesome! Very creative, u have to think w/out relying too much on book, kinda ""outta the box"". Prof also teaching addl classes that\'s why it takes 2 wks for grading, it\'s part of the ""system"". Responds to emails w/in 2-3 days. Happiness :-)"

Gives good extra credit and does a lot of stuff on her own time like on a tour of a jail, to a play, and got a lot of us involved in the soc club. It was a lot of fun. I\'m actually going to miss this class alot."

Her teaching style does use a lot of class discussion, so if you don\'t like that it might not be the class for you (but i perfer that to just straight lecture). Also, we nevr got out early, only the class the night before Thanksgiving, so anyway, i will take every class prof scott teaches from now on!!"

This teacher is new and doesn\'t have a clue what is going on. Most of the time we just read the book, did very simple projects and got let out early. I guess she read enough comments on here and got inspired to improve. Her inexperience is your gain. EASY A! TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!"

Half of the time she doesn\'t seem like she is even aware of what she is doing and just ask the students to read the book. I noticed that someone below gave her all 5\'s because she lets us out early and gives all EASY work. This is not the way to learn in COLLEGE!

Professor Scott was a clear and interesting teacher. If you didn\'t learn anything its probably has more to do with you then her teaching.

Please be advised that all you will do in this class is read the book and waste money and time.

She is lively, passionate and funny. An overall joy to be in her class, which is saying a ton because it is from 6:45-9:55. Great methods, offers lots of EC. Doesn\'t try to trick you on tests. Pay attention in class and read the chapters and you will be golden."
