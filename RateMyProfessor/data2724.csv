She really knows what shes talking about and is passionate about race, gender, and the ""alien other!"" Honestly, the best teacher that I have had in a higher class."

She is passionate about the class (sci-fi) and shows interesting films/provides insightful readings. This is an upper level AMST class so of course the readings are going to be numerous and tough, but she explains them well. This class is heavy on reading but if you like sci-fi for what it critiques of society/culture, take it!"

They take on the order of 3 minutes per page to read, because of the pseudo intellectual garbage pasted across each page. There\'s around 70 pages of readings per section (every other week). There\'s a three page paper every other week. The only way to write a decent paper is to write 5+ though."
