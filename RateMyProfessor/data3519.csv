You may think a class where you watch movies all the time is dope but its NOT. It\'s boring. Take notes because if you don\'t you basically failed. No homework. The only things in the grade book is the midterm, a project at the end of the semester and the final exam."

You show up, she lectures a bit, and watch a movie for 12 hours. There\'s virtually no homework in the class, and her midterm+final exams are take home, but very long and requires lots of googling and rewatching movies. There\'s also a creative project due at the end."

But you must be warned there is a lot of work and the finals are some of the longest you will take. But she is an easy grader and if you just participate in class, do the work and pay attention to the great movies she shows you\'ll get an easy A!"
