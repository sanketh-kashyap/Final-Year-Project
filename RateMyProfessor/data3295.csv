Her classes are interesting and never boring. In this class everyone can speak their opinion and it is a discussion class. Lots of homework and a group project at the end. A really easy class if you do your homework, study for tests, and just try."

The human resource simulator at the end of class is so fun I have had a blast doing this. Just pay attention in class and print out the powerpoints before hand. Half of the test material is included on the power points she gives you, half is not and you are expected to remember. Very funny! Tough tests."

Her grading criteria is very clear from the start. Three exams, learnsmart and connect assignments, and a simulation at the very end. Pay close attention in class and study hard. She will teach you a lot."

She lectures for the first 2/3 of the semester with 3 tests, all 50 questions and multiple choice. Then after your last test you do a simulation with a partner that equals another 100 points (or test grade). Connect and Learnsmarts are required. You get 2 points of credit for each class you go to. She posts PowerPoints online."

YOU WON\'T PASS.,1,0,I really enjoyed class with Dr. Coder. The lectures can get a bit boring and the material can be difficult to study but Coder is really helpful if you have any questions in or outside of class. The class ends with a simulation that is really cool and a lot of fun. Overall if you want to learn Coder is a great professor.

She gives good examples in class. However, the material is so closely related it makes the class (and tests) very hard to study for. All assignments are done online. She offers no extra credit. Show up to class and be prepared to stay fairly bored. If the material was interesting it would be easier."

She posts audio lectures online making it easy to review. This class was difficult for me because all of the terms used start sounding the same after a little while, but I don\'t think that is her fault. Just don\'t forget the chapter quizes on blackboard. I would gladly take her again."
