I am so happy that I took him for Eng 1A. This class was so easy and he is very easy going. He really understands the stresses of school, work, and personal life of a college student. He meets you halfway and treats you with the upmost respect. I will never forget him! I wish he taught Eng 1B at RCC. Awesome guy!"

He is a funny professor. Very sarcastic. Do NOT text in his class or be late. Those are extremely important to him. Does not grade that hard. Assigns 4 essays, but this is an ENGLISH class. Is not easy to contact through email, but is very helpful when talked to in person. Is passionate about his subject!"

Very funny, reminds me of Seth Rogen by his looks and his jokes. lol Class time is usually spent going over journal entries and group work. If you\'re not into essays you may hate it because he assigns 4 but other than that he never assigns homework. Meet minimum requirements with minor errors and you\'ll pass his"
