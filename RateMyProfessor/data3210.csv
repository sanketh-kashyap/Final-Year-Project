I kept a tally 4 insurance. He Is liberal,and if you have a conflicting point of view he will laugh,belittle,and gang up on you."

If you pay attention you actually learn a lot..his class is pretty interesting and he uses his own real life stories to help the class understand..he also lets you out early sometimes which is pretty tight..i definately recommend him..if you just do your homework and pay attention during lecture you\'ll do well.
