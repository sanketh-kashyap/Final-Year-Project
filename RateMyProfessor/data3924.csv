This class is a huge mess. By week 8 we were only on week 3 of the syllabus which she constantly blames us for. She is extremely condescending and her exams were 14 pages open book for 1 hour 15 minute class. Chair of the dept had to step in to make sure we all weren\xc3\xa2??t dropped from the program because of her horrible \xc3\xa2??teaching\xc3\xa2?? styles.

We took 3 weeks to do presentations on case studies. Got very behind in the class. First exam was ridiculous. Class time was not used well. Don\'t buy the syntax book. DO buy the Owens book. Good luck...

This class was useless. Attendance is mandatory and all she does is teach you about Blackboard all day, every day. Avoid her at all costs."

She\'s pretty useless. I think she understands what she\'s talk about, she\'s just not good at conveying anything. The project is graded pretty tough and it\'s based on stuff she ""taught"" you. AVOID HER! I hear other teachers for this course are way better."

However this prof completely drowns out any interest this subject may have had. She reads and teaches directly from the book; Her BB quizzes and exam questions are vague. I could just read the book, not go to class and I would get an A. Don\'t take her if you want to learn anything."
