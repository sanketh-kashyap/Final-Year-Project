Literally on the very first day she told us ""I almost got fired for not understanding this course fully."" and she proved that to be true every single day of the semester. Has no idea what she\'s doing and there is zero guidance for the huge paper. DO NOT TAKE HER."

Do not call her ""professor"" because she will yell at you and it will not be fun. She laughs at you if you\'re wrong and makes you feel less than human when you do something like leave class early for an appointment. RUN THE OTHER WAY!"

She is extremely disorganized and even admitted to us that she does not fully understand the course. She is very dismissive, scatterbrained, and her grading system is off. She offers very little feedback, even though the work load is extremely heavy. This class is not worth the stress."

Jana is an amazing communicator and enlightened me about society in a way I was unaware of. I recommend this class if you want to have a clearer view on different cultures. Some of the lectures were very moving.The material Jana used was mostly articles, which were excellent way to learn."

It was not boring at all. Try to do the readings before each class. They are actually interesting. Jana is an awesome professor. No exams, just some papers due, your choice topics. The final paper is time consuming, but you have plenty of time to work on it, and its done in group"

Sometimes unclear, but is very flexible with grading. Grade consisted of group presentations and take home tests."
