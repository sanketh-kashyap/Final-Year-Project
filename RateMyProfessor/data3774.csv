Mary Susan  Kennedy,Columbia State Community College,Classics department, Columbia, TN,7,4.3,N/A,2.5,Clear grading criteria (1)  Respected (1),6,04/24/2016,BUS1300,3.0,2.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,A+,,0,0,"I don\'t care for her as a teacher online. Little to no effort on her part, besides grading the 2 assignments - yes, 2! All docs and tests were pre-uploaded stuff she didn\'t even make herself; mostly just things from the teacher\'s version of the textbook. Quizzes easy, but tests way longer than necessary. 100 plus questions is overly excessive."

She is prompt about returning the graded assignments. I always felt that I could ask ANY question. I would definitely take another class led by this professor.

A remarkable teacher, a true professional but also personable. Excellent motivator! A true role model for assertive (not aggressive) interpersonal skills. Dr. Kennedy makes this subject come alive and makes it relatable. A lot of fun and engaging class activities pertaining to the subject. AWESOME!!!"
