Shaowen  Wang,University Of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Geography department, Champaign\xe2\x80\x93Urbana, IL,2,2.3,N/A,3.5,,2,10/20/2011,GEOG379,2.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,This is quite possibly the worst class I have taken here in terms of it being boring. He does not know how to teach at all. His voice make me want to stab my ears. Only go because his TA Eric Shook is fun to look at. Wait until the course goes online in the summer of 2012.

He did not teach gis that well. All he taught about was why his prototype program is better than that of gis. His TA Miriam Cope tried to teach everyone gis principles though.
