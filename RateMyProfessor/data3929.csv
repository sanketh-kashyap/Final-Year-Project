The information that you learn in this class will be very useful throughout life, no matter what field you go into."

He\'s more like a word-wizard when it comes to rhetoric. The Wilson Approach works. My only suggestion is that one should read his published narratives prior to registering.

He is all over the place and always shouts out The Wilson approach! which is useless. I still do not know what that is that was the purpose of his class. Horrible Teacher doesn\'t know what he is doing so don\'t waste your time and money.

The topics of discussion get you thinking and help your ability to argue a lot. I\'ve learned a ton from this guy and the work isn\'t too hard either. Definitely recommend Wilson.

However his lectures was all over the place. Some days we wouldnt even have lecture just talk. He does like to joke around alot. He\'s an easy A, but doesnt grade on time till end of semester, homework is nsubmitted online. Other than that he has a weird personality."

Unlike a lot of people in his profession he cares about the students who care about learning. You have to put the effort in if you want to learn. Everything is a sale ;)."

He doesn\'t really teach anything, and half the time he\'s just rambling to fill up time in the class so it looks like he\'s an actual professor. He\'s not easy to get ahold of and he is big on choosing favorites. Basically if your not his favorite you have no chance of getting an A. He\'s terrible."

Once you do, the class gives good insight on how to further enhance writing ability and the theory behind your writing in general. As a person he\'s easy to get along with. Take his class for a new look on English."

Almost every class, I sit there in disbelief that I spend my hard earned money to take it. Prof Wilson is extremely unclear with assignments and he avoids answering questions at all costs it seems! He jokes around WAY too much. He is a joke; honestly I hate to say this but it\'s true."
