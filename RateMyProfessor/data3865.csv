He always switches the syllabus and misspeaks leaving everyone confused. I never knew when the quizes in his class where because he is SO unclear and his syllabus is SO unreliable. Also, he ramble\'s in class so come test time, you dont know whats on it. His Study guides SUCK!"

Never looks at students and doesn\'t answer questions. Lectures on and on in a drony voice (all the while staring at the ceiling) Creates very UNhelpful slideshows. Very wordy, from england, Makes mistakes all the time, changes books in the middle of the course. VERY BORING!! NOT WORTH YOUR TIME/MONEY or SYMPATHY (Worst teacher ever!)"
