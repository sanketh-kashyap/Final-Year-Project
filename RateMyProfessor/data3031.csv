Sair  Hagopian,California State University Long Beach,Chemistry department, Long Beach, CA,1,3.0,N/A,2.5,,2,08/12/2010,CHEM323A,2.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Sair is a very nice guy, but don\'t let that fool you. He is so quiet that it\'s hard to hear him. He is also a very hard grader and is oblivious to how the other lab instructors grade their students. I am a straight A student and Sair gave me my only B while in college. Don\'t make the same mistake."
Sair  Hagopian,California State University Long Beach,Chemistry department, Long Beach, CA,1,3.0,N/A,2.5,,2,02/05/2009,CHEM323A,4.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Sair is just a generally kind man. He is a little confusing at time but if you ask him for help he will help you no questions asked. He is also very good at communicating outside of class like in office hours and emails. I would take his lab. He grades easy also and his lab write-ups are not ridiculous like most lab instructors are.
