Kumar  Tamma,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Mechanical Engineering department, Minneapolis, MN,8,2.5,N/A,2.1,,8,12/15/2017,ME5228,1.0,3.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,No,N/A,,3,0,"The lecture section was totally useless. The professor\'s talking style was annoying (such as say ""are you with me"" after every three sentences, which was even irritating), extremely blur with accent, and full of course irrelevant materials. Read the textbook carefully and often visit the TA office hour (the TAs were outstanding!), you\'ll get an A."

Teaches the theory to the class while leaving the problem examples for the TA. The professor and TA combo makes the class easy to understand from a theoretical and practical standpoint. Tests are fairly tricky.

Too bad he can\'t teach. Tests are fair and the grading is more than fair. Typically he has pretty good TAs. One of ours was Masao. He was priceless. Find another book. Erdman is crap, learn everything you need from that book. I would take a class with him again; but I wouldn\'t do it unless he was the only option."

Absolutely hilarious, class was FUN. Nothing extraordinary on HW\'s or exams. Would love to take another of his classes."

But Prof. Tamma is hilarious, enthusiastic and helpful. I\'ve never had more fun sitting in a lecture and listening. Great class, not too difficult."

The lectures are funny, but he spends the majority of the semester telling you how awesome finite element analysis is rather than actually teaching the material. The level of difficulty of the problems is not so bad though. If you can follow along lightly with the book this class is a breeze."
