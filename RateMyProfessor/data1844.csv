Her lectures are very thorough and cover all the material you need to know. Her practice tests and recitations are a great way to enforce the material you learn. Her office hours and review sessions are amazing and highly useful to succeed."

The most incomplete textbook was selected,lecture consisted of trivia questions over words NOT covered while TA\xe2\x80\x99s are available only to the Asian Center. When the rest of us attempt to get help we have to sit for hours outside her door while she ignores us, when we fail she flippantly tells take it over."

First semester of ochem went great for me, but second fell through. She\'s overall a great teacher with breaking the subject down and making it easy to understand, but her tests were horrifying. I had to retake second semester along with 3/4 of my class. However, it\'s a very tough class in general."

The course is tough, but she simplifies the material if you need it broken down. If you visit office hours she is very helpful, and I made the mistake of not visiting earlier in the course."

She curves the class and gives extra credit to compensate for her poor teaching skills. She is not teaching O Chem next year at UNL for a reason.

At time the lectures got a bit convoluted, but if you take the time to do her practice tests, and ask her questions during her office hours you will be fine.

I didn\'t use the textbook much, but if you go to class and ask her questions you will get a lot out of the class and a good grade.

I thought she was a great teacher at first since she was nice in grading and her exam is pretty much similar to the practice exam.
