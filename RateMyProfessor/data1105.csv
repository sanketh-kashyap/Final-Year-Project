I was upset that criminal law, the class I looked forward to the most, was taught so poorly. Avoid Saks if at all possible. His questions on the final include material never covered in class."

Left many questions unanswered. His essay question on final involved topics we never covered in class. No regularly scheduled office hours. I did not learn from class. I would never take his classes.

You should probably go occasionally, but a better use of your time is reading from supplements, the textbook, and Arizona and MPC statutes."

He was painfully boring and one of the hardest graders in law school. I had a great outline that included copious class notes and book notes and still didnt manage to pull off a decent grade. I would stay far, far, far away."
