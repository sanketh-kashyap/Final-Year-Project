I never thought I could understand math - she made it so clear and easy to get. And if you do the homework, you will know the subject enough to do well in the class. She is a nice person too - really cares about her students."

She really expects alot from students. Class attendance is mandatory. She gives alot of HW, plus checks everyday. Quizzes/tests aren\'t too bad, gets problems from HW. Textbook teacher, use book alot. Also if you\'re failing, you\'re out of luck. Wouldn\'t recommend if bad at math."
