I do not believe he was ever give a fair chance. Tough classes,good instruction, and I learned a great deal. Really fantastic rep choices."

He behaved in away that was not appropriate for a married man! He was not a very good director and I feel that he bought the level of the choir down, SIGNIFICANTLY!"

I was not sure what he was doing teaching at a college level and I feel like he should have stuck to high school. He never understood that we as a choir have opinions too and that he should try and incorporate them into his lesson.
