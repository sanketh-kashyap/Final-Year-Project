Pamela  Kray,Ramapo College of New Jersey,Communication department, Mahwah, NJ,0,2.0,N/A,2.0,,1,08/30/2009,COMM204,2.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Professor Kray is a sweetheart and picked some interesting movies to watch, but really doesn\'t know how to teach students. I rarely used the book she assigned and wrote her papers to best of my ability and managed to get an A. If you are okay with taking a class thats easy but willing to learn nothing then take her. She let us have cheat sheets!"
