YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,I took this course to fulfill a grad school prerequisite. I\'ve never had a teacher so disorganized in my academic career. Deadlines he posted were for the previous semester. He randomly changed assignment/quiz due dates. Goes off on non-accounting tangents and hurries lecture. You\'re better off teaching yourself accounting than taking his course.

He spent a lot of time rambling about things that had no relevance to the course. not very clear on how he wanted problems set up. very hard to follow.

He is very relaxed and ambiguous about how you should complete problems, but then he grades you down for minute things he said were not a problem. He also says many things are not on the exam, but they are and he does not remember saying otherwise."

Goes very fast through lectures so be prepared to stop him and ask questions when you need to otherwise you will get lost. Hes always willing to help if you need it. Be prepared for lots of homework. On average I spent 12-14 hours per week, but its needed to understand the material. All in all, pretty good teacher"

HW is only due when we go over it in class and nothing has a set due date. His lectures are boring, but if you just read the book and do the HW then you\'ll learn what you need. It\'s not a terrible class, but if you can find another ACCT20 class...I\'d recommend it."

Penmanship is total chicken scratch, he talks too fast and admits that he has some attention deficit issues. When I started the class we were at full capacity (40+ students) and at the end we had 13 students left. Quizzes weekly, which is ok, but he likes to make negative comments as he picks them up from your desk."
