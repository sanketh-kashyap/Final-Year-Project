Gwynn  Markle,Orange Coast College,Philosophy department, Costa Mesa, CA,3,2.5,N/A,2.5,,6,06/11/2013,PHIL120,4.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,2,0,"Dr. Markle is a good instructor. It is the material that is difficult. It is helpful to read the chapters several times before exams. If you attend class discussions, he goes over the readings to make it easier to understand, and he reviews before the mid-term and final. He is willing to help students before and after class."

The final was easy when given a practice final to review. Disappointed on my paper grade - if not interested in philosophy,looking for an easy A, or don\'t have much time, don\'t take this class."

He isn\'t helpful, and it\'s all online. You have to figure it out for yourself basically. Tests weren\'t too hard, it was just alot of weekly homework and quizzes. I wouldn\'t recommend him to someone who needs a clear communicator."

Expect to get ZERO feedback when it comes to how you are doing in the class. Left students confused as to what was going on when tests were supposed to be taken and were never posted, postponed quizzes multiple times because they weren\'t put up on time. The final exam was ridiculous."

Then she throws you a curve ball and expects you to have a 600 word paper along with a multiple long answer essay final all due fri by 5pm. She was throw off by the holidays and couldn\'t keep up with grading or getting back to students. It took her over a week to return my emails..
