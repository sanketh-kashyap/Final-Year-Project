Excellent wonton soup and egg rolls. I would recommend this to my friends.

Not very responsive to emails. This didn\'t bother me because I got an A on every assignment, but it did become a problem for others. Provided good feedback when grading my writing and even suggested that bc of my writing style, I might do well in 202A. But I\'m a Business major, so no thanks."

Doesn\'t allow anything from _Unearthed Arcana_. WTF did he have us buy the book? I don\'t understand the near-constant references to Vance. Encounter descriptions are minimal at best. Worse than Arneson by far (and he\'s dead).

A lot of useless assignments designed to waste your time. If possible, avoid this guy.."

This class isn\'t a cakewalk - but Patton does make it harder than it needs to be. His comments become monotonous and aren\'t very helpful. If you\'ve good English skills and are a good student you\'ll do fine though.

I\'m doing very well in the class, but he\'s not helpful and doesn\'t ""instruct"" at all. He deliberately phrases his assignments and communication in a complicated manner to force you to interpret, take this course from someone other than Joel Patton."

I don\'t know what is due when, or even what the assignments consist of. I am currently in my 17th and 18 WC classes. Patton is the worst teacher I have had. He takes what should be easily digested information, and turns it into a universe of uncertainty and suffering. GPA - 3.92 (pre-Patton)."
