I thought definitely do not recommend this guy he goes off on incredibly boring tangents, gives out pop quizzes that are not related to anything! For the exams he grades strictly! I used examples he said over and over in class and still got a 74. Seriously, my Calc3 class was easier!"

Also, he gives ""pop"" quizzes once a week that are impossible to get a 100 on."
