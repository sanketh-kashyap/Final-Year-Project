She is younger and more down to earth and personable. She has a non-profit for work place bullying and is passionate about it. She is connected and knowledgeable about the subject. She is also very encouraging.

Don\'t need to stay the entire time in class. Lectures for a bit and then allows class to leave. Assignments have clear directions. Quizzes, some work in class, research paper and presentation on your research topic. Would take professor again."

If your speech topic doesn\'t interest her, she\'ll most likely give you a bad grade. I highly recommend taking this course with another teacher."

Course was poorly designed but she changed it on the fly to try to make it work as best as could be.
