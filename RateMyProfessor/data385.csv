PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,"Andrea is a great person and teacher, but keep in mind that if you respect her and respect the work that you do in her class she will respect you. Be ambitious on your projects and put in the effort to make it work, she may not say she likes it to your face and she won\'t tell you what to do but if you show up on time and do your best she notices."

Not the easiest teacher but she challenges you in expanding your 3-D creativity! This is my favorite class!

Attendance is a must in her class. Sometimes she can be unclear but she always ends with ""does that make sense"" to make sure everyone understands. she loves ambitious projects . hates the simple ones.Be prepared to spend a lot of cash"

She allows plenty of artistic freedom, but expects you to follow directions and stick to deadlines religiously. Maybe her feedback isn\'t always the best, but she is very involved with her students and obviously want the best for them."

During a critique she\'ll say all sorts of sweet things to your face but when it comes to evaluations you\'ll see the total opposite come out. I didn\'t learn anything. She\'s a waste of time--and money.

The class assignments were alright but I felt like I could\'ve learned a lot more if I was with another professor

(1),9,08/20/2009,ABC3DIS,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,She was really nice to everyone and helpful. She really likes it when you stick to the directions rather than going off into doing something more imaginative and creative. Rather than being abstract she likes it when you put all of your effort into projects. graded mostly by all the work you put into projects.
