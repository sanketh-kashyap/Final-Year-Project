Her notes and lectures make absolutely no sense. The entire class is self-study on the book. However, she is fairly easy and tells you what exactly will be on the test and several book questions are on her test. Kraka knows her stuff she just can\'t teach it to others."

However, sometimes she lies.. Study the book and always look at the questions from the hmk, even if she tells you not to. I had her for chem 025 also and I think she got harder for chem 027. She has a horrible accent. Attend class b/c it\'s part of participation."

Notes are a bit disorganized on the board and can be hard to follow at times. In some cases, it may just be best to learn from the book. However, she is a very reasonable teacher. 5 tests and she drops the lowest grade and then a final. She gives you hints on what will be on the tests the lecture before."

Spends the lecture before an exam going over what will be on the exam. She does a make up exam where you can drop your lowest test score. Her tests aren\'t that bad. Shes very sweet, I recommend any class with her."

The notes she writes on the board can be disorganized. Straightforward tests and she gives plenty of assistance to students when asked .. during the test. Unfortunately, this semester she\'s been gone about 7 lectures, a few times without warning, leaving us with subs."
