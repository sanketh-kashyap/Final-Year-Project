She moves at a fast pace & reads off her powerpoint presentations. She also does exercises from what she just taught you. She is willing to help if you ask her. This class is hard, so I say attend every class and keep up with your work!"

Math is far from my favorite subject but I actually really enjoyed her class. Expectations are clearly stated and O\'Hearn was very helpful. Don\'t miss class and keep up with HW, and you will do great!"

Worst teacher I\'ve ever had (including high school, four years of college, and grad school). Arbitrary grader who cannot justify why she gives you the grades she does. Makes you think FIDM just really doesn\'t care who teaches us. Unless you want someone to make you feel bad about yourself every class, stay away."

If you are in kindergarten and are looking for someone to read to you about how to merchandise as a buyer, then fine- take her. But her presence in class is completely invalid and incredible shrill. She looks like the ""other mother"" from Coraline. She comes off as if she hates her job - her teaching proves it."
