Roger  Hamrick,California State University Dominguez Hills,Management department, Carson, CA,6,1.0,N/A,3.0,,2,11/10/2015,QAS100,1.0,5.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,,0,0,Roger Hamrick is one of the least professional and generally unpleasant people I have ever come across. He obviously hates his job and is a misanthrope. He helps manage a distance learning and doesn\'t understand the concept of different time zones and the urgency of exams.

It is clear that he hates students and he treats them with thinly veiled contempt. He appears to also hate his job in general. Roger is an advisor, if you can get around him, do it."
