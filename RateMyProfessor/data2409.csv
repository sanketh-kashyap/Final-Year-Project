LECTURE HEAVY,0,0,"Damon gets a bad rep, but hes actually a really good professor. If you go to class, he gives you all the answers just print off the study guide and he answers every question. His tests are straight forward and his lab is super super easy. Sure, he mumbles but sit up front and you can hear him fine, he wont call on you ever."

He is also a difficult grader and randomly takes off points without giving feedback. If you study, you\'ll get a good grade but if you\'re looking for an interesting class, this isn\'t it."

Your grade in the class depends on 4 tests (2/3 of your overall grade) and labs (1/3 of your overall grade). Very lecture heavy and quiet speaker

Really tough grader on labs but if you study you should do well on the exams. I would recommend taking the course with him, but its nothing to write home about either."

His class is so boring its hard to hear what her is saying and see what her is writing. The lab with him was alright. He gives you study guides with the answers on the exam. He only has 3 exams and a final which is accumulative..I personally hated him and the class.

Only have had him for two weeks, but he already seems boring. He kind of expects you to know things that you definitely do not know. Hopefully his tests aren\'t hard, but the material definitely is. More to come..."
