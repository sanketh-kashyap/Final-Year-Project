He really cares about the students and made the class interesting. It was a summer course so we had 2 tests, and 3 papers. I would take more psych courses with him because I actually learned material through discussion and lecture."

His class style is very laid back. He doesn`t put slides on BB so you may want to take pix of them. Exams are fair, he tells you whats going to be on there but he will make you work. A lit review is due, as well as a structured interview and 3 exams. He gave extra credit. Highly recommend Leatherman"

The class is enjoyable, but don\'t be fooled, the test is hard. Attendance is not mandatory, but it will help you pass the tests. He\'s tough on the paper, so put effort...but flexible and will take it late if you have a good reason for delay. Very understanding and just a nice guy all around!!"
