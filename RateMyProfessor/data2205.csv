YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,"Much better of a professor than Dr Burns, so you can actually learn the content. Despite not getting much out of E1 and having sub optimal circuit analysis skills, I felt E2 was pretty easy. The tests are fair and very similar to hw. Only thing to beware of: Tang grades on a normalized bell curve, so the class average becomes the cutoff for a C."

There were 3 homework assignments, a group project, 2 very difficult labs and then the final. I had a B going into this but with 40% of the grade being decided in the last two weeks my grade dropped. Very difficult last few weeks"

His ability to present the material in an understanding way other than just ""cause reasons"" is excellent. The tests are fair as long as you study sufficiently. Circuit analysis skills are required heavily (much more than E1). Take his class!"

If you have Dr. Burns or Dr. Yang for E1 then this class will be easy. A lot of the material is the same just a little more in depth. He is a very good teacher, he can be a harsh grader on the tests but they are open notes so they are doable. I\'d take him again."

Course material was somewhat difficult but Dr. Tang was amazing at explaining it so that I could understand. Very approachable and willing to help you if you ask him questions. Tests could throw a curve ball at times but weren\'t awful."
