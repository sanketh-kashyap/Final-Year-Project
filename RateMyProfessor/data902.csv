She makes the lab experiments and reports so easy and very clear. Although her class is an easy A, she makes the class fun and exciting while teaching at the same time. Very funny, easygoing. It\'s a shame I didn\'t try hard enough and ended up with a B in the class instead of an A . Recommended!"

She made the class easy, and she\'s very approachable. She\'s also lenient with late work. I only took a 1 credit lab class with her, but overall it was a fun class."
