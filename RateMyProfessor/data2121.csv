I was a pretty lazy student, so at first I wasn\'t excited about studying as much.She has so much life and is so original in her teaching, that it inspired me to do better. Today,I value being on the Dean\'s list/ President\'s list. I got it! I\'ll always strive 4 better! Tks Dr Francis! You\'re a great inspiration!"

It was pretty fustrating sometimes especially when taking other classes. I know American students arent at the top of the worlds academic chain but try to give us a break anyw
