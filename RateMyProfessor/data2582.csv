Has a tendency to shove things down your throat. She asked us to point out any mistakes on her power points. When I pointed out that American Barr Association does not have tow r\'s in Bar, she told me I was wrong. Okay!"

The only ""indoctrination"" that exist in this Prof\'s class room is Sociological. If you enter a sociology class w/o an open mind you very well may be offended."

She is very passionate about what she does for a living. And although she may be strict, she is an excellent teacher. Remember: you\'re in COLLEGE, you\'re not in high school anymore. She expects you to take responsibility and follow directions CAREFULLY. Take her class... trust me"

If you dont mess around in class and ACTUALLY pay attention, you will have no problems with her. I never even bought a text book and made an A in every class I took. If you follow do the study guides and study them for the exam, you will do perfectly fine. If you ask questions, you\'ll get answers."

I can see how some may think she is rude, however those people who tear her a new one on here are probably the ones who failed. She is friendly, helpful, and has made a big impact on my career. I HIGHLY recommend her as a professor. She is fantastic!"

Not helpful and although she says to voice your opinion get\'s pi**ed when you do and she doesn\'t agree.

She can be kind of rude. Very strict on cellphones.....as she should be since some are disrespectful with them in class. My main complaint is that you only have 3 tests and a project to make your grade. Tests are OK. You can use your book for the test.

If you answer a question that she asks you better have the exact one she has in her head or she will tear you down in front of the whole class. The tests are crazy if you don\'t read the text book and rely on her power points alone you will fail. You are not required to bring your text book, but I recommend it. Did I say RUDE!!!"

I have just finished my online class with her, and I found it to be very educational and entertaining. If you just put a bit of effort into the material, you will leave with a deserving grade.

All she will tell you is to refer to the class documents-not helpful AT ALL. She always says what you\'re doing wrong in assignments but doesn\'t provide ways to improve your faults. Kinda rude too."

She begins the semester with a hard shell but is actually much more lenient than she appears. She does NOT stand for asking for leniency infront of other students, but will infact give it if you go to her office. For tests she gives study guides and powerpoints and her exams are very easy!!"

She allowed students to come in late all the time, which was distracting. However, the one time I was late, she mentions the attendance policy with an attitude.
