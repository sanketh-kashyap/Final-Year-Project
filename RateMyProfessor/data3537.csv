He is very fair with his grades. Hes a student himself so he can understand. I recommend you take his class.

Taught the material clearly, he was organized and encouraged everyone to ask questions which he always answered. He gave reviews before his 4 tests and they were easy, everything he went over. Pay attention, engage in class conversation and you will do fine. Love him!"
