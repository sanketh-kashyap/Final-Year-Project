None of us can understand her, she makes the easiest material very confusing, and we didn\'t even get to the last 3 chapters of the class because she has no lesson plans and can\'t keep track of time. I\'m dreading 121 because I barely understood 101 thanks to her."

After taking her class and failing, I should\'ve listened to my friends! This teacher is so HARD!!! I lost my interest in biology and with that my grade is far from gone thanks to her! She is THE WORST TEACHER EVER and can\'t teach anything!!!"

I mean first she says that attendance isn\'t mandatory and then marks off points for people who are late. Her clarity is horrible and her grading is very strict- without partial credit. She\'s not a teacher, she\'s a bully- DO NOT TAKE HER, SAVE YOUR GRADE!!!"

Thought it was fairly easy. I really didn\'t do anything outside of class and got an A. Don\'t really understand the harsh criticism. She has an accent but is easy to understand, she answered all questions, exams were from the lectures. I hate science and thought it was a pretty easy course. Just put in enough effort."
