Vicky  Schwan,Santiago Canyon College,Not Specified department, Orange, CA,3,3.0,N/A,3.7,,6,06/11/2012,SIGN112,4.5,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,1,Vicky is a very sweet lady. She is very helpful. If you need help with a quiz or exam if you stay after class she will help you out so there should be no reason not to pass. There are students who don\'t like to pay attention so if you are one of those don\'t take this class. She does have a different teaching style but it is very helpful! take her!

As long as you respect her no voice rule and attend class you\'ll be fine. Her teaching style is diff but very helpful. Helps after class with quizzes and exams so no excuse for not passing!!

She is strict, mean and unapproachable! You are lucky if you learn anything from her. She teaches you vocabulary that ASL users don\'t even use anymore. The class is a huge waste of time!"

She invited guest speakers that shared her animosity towards anything but ASL, which is not useful towards teaching hearing people the language, nor in developing small children in the use of language."
