Lynette  Nickleberry,University of Missouri - Columbia,Human Development department, Columbia, MO,8,1.9,N/A,3.7,GRADED BY FEW THINGS (1)  Tough Grader (1)  SO MANY PAPERS (1),3,01/16/2017,CHS0950248A85F,1.0,5.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,No,N/A,SO MANY PAPERS  TOUGH GRADER  GRADED BY FEW THINGS,0,0,Truly an awful experience. An exceptionally large amount of work was given out. The work was not returned with comments in a. timely manner on anything but the response papers. She was a very difficult professor to deal with and if you demonstrated true knowledge of her subject she seemed to take it personally.

Lynette is knowledgeable but her teaching style is very scattered. The three hour lecture was used very inefficiently. Class discussions were the best part but the information from those was hardly usable on tests. It would be a much better class if it was better structured.

She doesn\'t seem to know anymore than the students and makes us write journals for every class on the reading and then dont even go over them. The class is just busy work and is pretty useless. It would be better is she were more knowledgeable.
