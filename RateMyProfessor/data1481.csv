Developmental biology is a confusing subject, so I can\'t blame him for the difficulty of the class. He gives study guides that help a lot! I can\'t remember how many exams there were (maybe 3?). There\'s plenty of class exercises which makes attendance mandatory. Overall, I would recommend if he ever teaches it again."

(1)  Respected (1),5,11/06/2014,BIO212,4.0,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"He simplifies everything you need to know. The basics. He does not go off on tangents as much. His Iclicker points are participation points (sometimes). His free response questions are simple. (example: What are the products of photosynthesis?) Tip: Read the text book before lecture, memorize lecture. I aced both his exams with 93.33%."

Study his studyguides and you\'ll be fine for the test. He doesn\'t try to trick you or anything. Great professor overall. His lectures were interesting, but my friend kept distracting me by saying ""Dr. L is so hot."""

Office hours are great, hes a really nice and understanding professor"

He gives real life examples of what he\'s talking about and does little analogies that help you remember concepts. He thought the second part of the course (genetics and gene expression) - it is a rather tedious subject to learn, BUT if you follow his study guides you should do fine. Also, his quizzes are harder than his test"
