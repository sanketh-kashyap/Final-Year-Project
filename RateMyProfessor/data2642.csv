Her class consists of 1 paper submitted each week ranging from 500-750 words and discussing what you wrote about once in class. Would definately take her again

Her writing class involved a short paper of 500-750 words every week. No long projects, no research necessary, no tests/quizzes, no other homework. Assignments are peer graded and she gives them a look-over as well. Interesting content and teacher on top of all that."

Does a lot of peer grading andor allows you to create your assignments... as in... it doesn\'t have to be a boring written paper. It can be a visual, a presentation, a performance, a piece of art... just something you created to display that which you\'ve learned either for the course or section. Awesome lady!"

She\'s kinda crazy but in a good way. Very laid back, doesn\'t really care about formats even though it\'s a writing class. Would definitely recommend."

I am taking her this quarter for upper div history and really like it. She makes history fun and a likable subject. she does not assign alot of readings or make you waste money on books like most instructors do. Only one book required. Also she is very friendly and open. Take her class you wont regret it.

Professor Seed oftentimes rambles on or goes off tangents, but if you\'re interested in the topics then it does no harm. On the other hand, if you aren\'t interested, this class probably might seem boring."

Got me no interest in pursuing the history field. Keeps droning on and on. I fell asleep every time. TA this year graded REALLY HARD!! Definitely not an option of ""easy A"" if you want to take her class. MUST PUT IN EFFORTS TO EARN AN A!! Her class policy changes every year. Weird professor."

Three essays based on movies for the Latin American class. Only one textbook, don\'t really use it too much, some online reading. The final was multiple choice, pretty easy if you just do the reading and come to class."

Easily distracted and will go off on random topics that really have nothing to do with history.
