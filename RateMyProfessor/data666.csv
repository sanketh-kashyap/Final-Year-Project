To those interested in the field of Environmental Biology, I HIGHLY recommend this professor. Those who don\'t have an interest may find it slow and a bit dry at times, but it\'s not difficult to get through! A great experience. :)"

Mr Haughey knows his stuff and has very interesting lectures. Injects a bit of humor into his exams. :) I loved how he teaches people to care about the environment around them and really puts things into perspective. Fun class! Tests aren\'t hard, you just need to show up to classes to get the knowledge."
