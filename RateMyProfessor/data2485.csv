Anthony  Bak,Mount Holyoke College,Mathematics department, South Hadley, MA,0,3.7,N/A,3.3,,3,05/27/2009,MATH203,2.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Easiest but worst...To buy a textbook or not is a hard choice because he basically is just a copy machine of textbook...Extremely unorganized... He stays one month on easiest stuff and rushes through the final 3 chapters(which are most important and difficult) in 2 weeks...Finally he\'s gone...

Original, fun, practical, always ready to learn and explore with students. Definitely recommend taking his class...but unfortunately he will not be teaching at MHC after spring 2009. :("
