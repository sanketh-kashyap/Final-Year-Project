Stanislaus  Lojasiewicz,Rochester Institute of Technology,Mathematics department, Rochester, NY,5,2.9,N/A,3.0,LOTS OF HOMEWORK (1)  Tough Grader (1)  Get ready to read (1),4,11/21/2014,DISCRETE,2.5,4.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"The grade is only based on 3 test, 1 final, and a quiz every class. The test questions are mostly easy but some had nothing to do with the homework that was supposed to prepare you for the test. Lectures are lengthy, boring, and all over the place. You are better off just trying to learn by doing the homework. Would not recommend."

Took a while to understand his accent but you get used to it. His grading is kind of funky with no curve and quizzes every class all for a total of 100 points. All of his quizzes and tests are open notes which kind of makes you dependent on them for the final, on which they aren\'t allowed. Overall, a good professor."

Thought i was doing okay, and ended up with a C. Only grades come from quizzes every week, 3 tests, and final. Professor uses long and unnecessarily complicated methods . Very nice, but not helpful or easy to get an A."

Lectures are understandable. He has a thick polish accent, which all might not be able to understand well. However, his tests are easy and the whole course is open book and open notes."
