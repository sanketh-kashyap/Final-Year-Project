I personally liked the class maybe because I like talking about differences btw cultures but many students feel that its not that eye opening and they didn\'t get much out of it - slide show lecture style (aka you might find this boring)."

MIIS accepts over 80% of MBA applicants, so you will work with people who can\'t write, can\'t do research, and can\'t use a computer. You will have to do extra because all team members get essentially the same grade. Wait for Dean Scalberg to take out his MIIS cattle brand during the export readiness workshop!"
