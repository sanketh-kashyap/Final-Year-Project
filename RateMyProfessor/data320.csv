I got a good grade 1/2 bc I follow a lot of social justice blogs on tumblr and 1/2 bc I\'m good at BSing. Great subject and instructor, poor execution"

No computers allowed in her lectures unless you sit in the front. Take the class with friends so you can share notes on the reading. If I did not have a good TA I would not be doing well it he class.

GET READY TO READ,0,0,"She teaches the class as if we were all grad students, and WE ARE NOT! She assigns a ridiculous amount of reading, and she moves quickly. Each lecture is pretty random--no common thread or logical class format at all. She\'s incredibly smart but not good at teaching undergrads. Thank god my TA is awesome."

It seems like she doesn\'t realize students have other classes too. There are A LOT of readings every single day. In half a week, she assigned an entire novel to be read. In class she moves much too quickly for students to keep up. Very, very boring class."

If you line up directly with her interests, great. If not, run like the wind. She seems benevolent and interested in her students, but she is not."
