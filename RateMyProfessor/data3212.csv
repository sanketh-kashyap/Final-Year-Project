He really doesn\'t care about your understanding and actually just expects you to perfectly understand it and becomes angry if you don\'t. He gives incredibly hard tests that are virtually impossible to study for and is boring AF"

Sometimes rambles on about stories that are not related to class but keeps it interesting. Not a lot of studying needed to get A\'s on test. Deff not a time consuming class! 5.0 for sure!

Boring lectures but half the time you just watch movies. He doesn\'t give like anything you do back. but he tells you how to do all the labs and the paper step by step. Plus the paper is soo easy because he wants pictures.
