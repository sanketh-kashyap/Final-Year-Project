Just be sure to take him as close to your first semester of ACCT because the information never stops building. Do not fall behind or it\'s very difficult to catch up.

I took him over summer and it was brutal. It was my second time taking Acct 301 and the things he taught and the exercise we did was so deep I felt like i had never seen this material. He makes it harder than it has to be and his exams are extra crazy where M/c questions are tricky and journal entries its very rare to get partial credi

Professor Warne makes you work for your grade, he\'s a no nonsense kind of guy. BUT he truly wants you to learn and do well. If you show up to class and put in effort you will pass. Make sure you do well on the first two exams. The final is brutal! Overall, take him - I\'m glad I did."

Guy literally does the filtering of the knowledge necessary of his class and puts the important stuff on PP. Very good guy as a person. Good stories as an auditor (Auditing Utah Prison). Guy writes CPA problems for AICPA. Very smart dude. Cares for students and is a great guy. Would have a beer with him.

His homework and his in-class activities are not like his exams. His exams are very tricky, half the class failed. I would not recommend taking him."
