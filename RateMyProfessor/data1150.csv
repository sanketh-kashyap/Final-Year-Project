He is elitist and most of the time won\'t shut up about UC Los Angeles and is not proud of UC Irvine and Long Beach State. Damn shame; only talks with white people and the ""top students.""

I had him when he taught at Fullerton College and not only does he act like he knows it all, but he requires you to go on stupid field trips.

P.Szeto is really smart and passionate about what he does. He has a good sense of humor. Pay attention and take notes!

He seems intimidating at first, but its really not that hard of a class.

His classes are intellectual and hes actually very funny."

Test consists of the art we saw in his powerpoint and the art from the book(so pay attention to them and you must read). Must go to two museums and write a 5 page paper for each.

This guy obviously thinks he\'s the sh** cos he\'s teaching college level art course..funny... throwing verbose expressions that only makes sense to him.
