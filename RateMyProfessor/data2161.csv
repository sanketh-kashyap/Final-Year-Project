He is very knowledgeable and genuinely wants his students to succeed. Be prepared to read and a fair amount of work but it\'s not tedious work. I\'m probably the worst procrastinator in history & I actually found myself finishing the assignments way before they were due.

It\'s like he\'s trying to introduce unnecessary difficulty, handing out less than good grades not because student\'s didn\'t try, but because mathematically it was impossible for them to succeed. I don\'t get his motivations at all."

Crystal clear, insightful, and entertaining lectures from which I learned a lot. The workload was nothing to sneeze at, and by no means does he grade lightly, but assignments are nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable. Very friendly guy."

He comes off as an easy marker until you get an essay/test back and he craps all over it. Take his class but be prepared to go the extra mile.
