Sally  Frumkin,Cypress College,Nursing department, Cypress, CA,5,2.9,N/A,2.8,,4,08/07/2014,NURS193,1.0,1.0,Mandatory,N/A,N/A,A,,1,0,"Professor Frumkin is for people that want to get an easy grade. She is NOT open to questions. If you like to talk a lot, I will suggest to take other teacher because she will tell you to be quiet right on your face. Gives you a lot of extra work to do, no need for that. She humiliates you in front of people. She will pass u on clinical easily."

Once she has gotten to know you, she is very caring and helpful. Just don\'t goof off and waster her time."

She does not like when people talk in class...as it should be! She kind of gets ahead of herself at times and seems hyper. My opinion of her is that she\'s a kind person if you just take the time to actually have a conversation with her..she\'s very empathetic. Overall she\'s good!
