I can honestly say I am getting tired of professors relying on this crap for IT course work. Her english is sometimes funny in emails, but who uses spellcheck anymore. Responses via email can be a little slow. No extra credit, so if you start going downhill don\'t."

You\'re not going to be spoon-fed the material, and will have to study. But it\'s worth it to go to class and try, because then she won\'t fail you. She is a great prof and very understanding, you just have to try!"

When she does post things for her online class there are many spelling errors, which makes me wonder if she\'s even legit. lol She doesn\'t answer questions, and she\'s just irritating. If you have the choice, NEVER take any of her classes."

One 1-page discussion essay thing with at least 2 peer responses, one test, one 50 question assignment (which include 5 ""short answer"" questions - i.e. mini-essays) and two 40 minute online labs PER WEEK for an intro to computers course. YUCK"

And what\'s worse is that she makes it really complicated - waaaay more complicated than it is. It\'s the BEGINNING of the semester and I already hate her."
