She seems to be bothered by the littlest things, just be the average student and do not try to go beyond the call of duty and all will be phenomenal."

She tries to be fun and cool but then turns around and treats the class like firstgraders so her attitude can be confusing at times. She is helful if you email her your questions. Tries to make class fun. Dont get on her badside. Overall she is good.

Whoever does badly in her classes is just dumb. She treats the class like we\'re mentally disabled. Such a joke. If you want an A, take the class, but only if you could deal with constant annoyances."

You have 4 speeches, and little quizes after every few chapters. She\'s a cool lady, and really tries to give everybody a good grade even if they\'re not great at making speeches. It\'s impossible not to do well in her class. I totally reccommend her!!!"
