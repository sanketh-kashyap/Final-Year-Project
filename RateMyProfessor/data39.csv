She is always there for me when I ask for advice on job hunting, writing letters, and ways to better succeed at the university overall. She is an excellent person to have on your side too. I really enjoy her classes, especially Writing on the Job."

She thought in middle and high school (trade school) but i don\'t think she is suited for a University level. She is teaching Oral Communication course but we couldn\'t barely hear what she is saying unless you sit in the front row. Not easy to follow and assumes you understand everything.

Very easy class & I actually enjoyed some of the stories. Had to read 1-3 stories a week, and pass in 2 paragraph response for each one. Two 2page papers, midterm and a final. Easy, enjoyable and good teacher. For an elective? u wont regret"

She is clear,articulate and she is brilliant with classic communication (i.e., verbal and written communication). Her only flaw is that she lacks knowledge of current technology and social media which is essential in business communication."
