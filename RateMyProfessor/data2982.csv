One of the clearest lecturers I\'ve ever had, and very funny and friendly on top of that. Lots of material, but she makes it straightforward. Splits larger projects into very reasonable pieces. Extremely supportive; will always make times for anyone. I took two courses from her and still miss both of them more than two years later."
