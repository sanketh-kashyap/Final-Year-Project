Very loud, animated and opinionated. He\'s awesome. I enjoy his class. He believes in some silly things though, like how 9/11 was a controlled demolition and that Obama wasn\'t a US citizen. And hes religious. Doesn\'t bother me too much though, like I said he\'s great"

Having him for religion was a blast. The class can be a little difficult because he isn\'t very clear. Although, I do not appreciate his bias opinion towards catholicism and christianity. He misinterprets the catholic church and bases it off his bias opinion"

He claims he wants you to question everything yet doesn\'t follow that through in his discussions. Isn\'t clear on grades or assignment content and very unpredictable when it comes to due dates and what not. Would NOT recommend

In order to pass his class u have to agree with everything he says especially on the papers. He likes to have discussions, but won\'t really answer your questions. I could not take him serious."

He was all over the place goes off tangent. He assigns test/assignments one day then changes the due date which can be very stressful. I personally wouldn\'t recumbent his classes. He\'s a very good person but I regret taking any of his courses.
