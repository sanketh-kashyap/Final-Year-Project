He does an excellent job of providing students with either side of an argument whether it correlates with his view, your view, or any other person\'s view. He is respectful to all his students and provides ample opportunity to pass."

He teaches the subject fairly giving valid examples from both sides. If you have a different viewpoint, he acknowledges and nurtures what\'s on your mind. Laid back atmosphere, and wonderful classroom discussions. 1010 would take again. I got a B because I didn\'t study."

He\'s able to teach the class in a way that helps you learn the material but also makes you feel invested. I took him over a Maymester and wish I would\'ve taken him during a long semester. If you see his name listed as your professor, don\'t worry; you\'re in great hands."

He\'s well versed on IR and has tons of cool experiences to share. Some people had a difficult time with quizzes/tests. Make sure you\'re in class each day for pop quizzes and take good notes!"

I studied hardcore for the tests though (there were only 2; a midterm and final). He\'s very nice but gives you a few pop quizzes to monitor attendance but if you miss one or two it\'s no big deal. I didn\'t read any of the books but got a B on the final paper/presentation and as my final grade.

Thoroughly answer the review study guide he posts online and you\'ll be fine. He curves the exams so that the class average is a 75. My average for the class was a 101."

I only got a C because I was lazy and didn\'t read. He\'s easy going if your miss an exam and have a good reason for it. He just wants yuo to do well and pass."
