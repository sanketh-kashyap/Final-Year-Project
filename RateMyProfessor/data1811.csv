It made no sense to take notes in his class if they were useless to his exam. He knows his stuff but sucks at testing ur knowledge. ps must read textbook and memorized it

Easy to get along with. Tests online - some difficult questions. Alot of interesting discussions. Talk in class, he\'ll respond. Overall, a great teacher and he\'s easy to relate to. Take his class."
