Midterm takes a little time to complete and final group project is a paper based on a mock negotiation. Key for both papers is to use book terms and define them. You stay the full time for the first half of semester but get out early rest of the way. Highly recommend"

Personally very disappointed because you don\'t learn much out from the course. Lectures just mention material in book. Exercises actually don\'t teach you how to negotiate better.

Very knowledgable and has many real world examples. Requires reading the text box. Overall fun class.

I would highly recommend it as a good 3 credit class that is enjoyable and isn\'t crazy with the work. Great in class exercises and very funny prof. Very worthwhile.

Text book readings are a little long and boring, but fun class exercises reinforce the points. Prof is great with personal stories that show real life experiences. Mid-Term exam was take home and required ~4 hours to complete. Final Project was team project. Highly recommend this class & professor."
