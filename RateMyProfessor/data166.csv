I wish I could have taken it every semester. The class was so helpful that I did not have to study for family law on the bar at all. Everything I learned from Professor Willig, I still use as a practicing attorney on a daily basis."

Really cares about her students--helps them get jobs. Many other lawyers come to class, I guess because she is so respected in the legal community. She may bethe best teacher I have evr had."

I have had at UM! She is very good at teaching, because she is very clear and funny. I learned so much from her and would take another class with her in a heartbeat. Some people thought that her exam was hard, but if you do all the work it is fine. She prepares you well for real world law practice."
