YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,"Highly recommend this class if you are willing to put in the work. She assigns homework for each class, but they are easy assignments. Attendance is mandatory, so be there onetime and everyday unless excused. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities, so take advantage of them all. Study guides for test are provided and VERY useful. Pleasant."

Tests usually cover 3-4 chapters; she just collects some random lab reports."

Weekly lab quizzes, lowest dropped. 3 tests, lowest dropped. Cumulative final. 90% of the labs are awful, but I blame the curriculum, not her. She didn\'t write the lab manual. Always answered student questions reasonably."

Furhtermore, the tests were not that hard nonetheless you really didn\'t know what they would be on...no study guides were ever provided...bottom line I would not take this lady again!"

She did seem like she may have been an elementary teacher. she didn\'t have much control over the class. but her class was easy easy easy. i thought i hated biology before this class, but i was pretty interested. she is overall a sweet teacher and she will be much more willing to help you if she sees that you are trying"

Never let us learn from what we got wrong, was behind on lectures to labs so we got tested on things we hadn\'t learned. Never knew the answer when someone asked a question, never offered to find out. Lecture style tedious, always seemed unprepared, said ""um"" all the time. Don\'t take!!"

If you take this class get ready to write a crap load of notes. Lecture time was all note taking which can get very boring. It is hard to miss any class because there are so many notes and you have

You have to write down her PPTs if you want the info. M/C tests, weekly lab quizzes. Drops worst test and quiz. You need to show up, pay attention, and study if you want to do well. Does talk to class as if we were kids, but holds you responsible for your work."

Seems like she may have been an elementary teacher in the past, explains assignments as if you were a 6 year old. Labs are fairly interesting, again if you can handle being spoken to like a child. Overall an easy A if you like BIO if not find a more exciting prof"
