Santos  Roman,Moreno Valley College - Riverside CCD,Religion department, Moreno Valley, CA,1,4.7,N/A,1.7,,3,05/27/2010,HUM10,4.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Very fun and interesting guy. Likes to talk a lot, but keeps it entertaining. Ten take home key-term quizzes, ten terms each. No tests. Five, 2-page reading response papers and 1 final paper. Really easy to get good grades on them. And if you\'re offended by foul language, he\'s not the teacher for you. Overall, fun, interesting, easy class. =]"

I loved the material that we learned and I felt that I took alot away from the class when it was over. I would gladly take another class taught by Santos Roman."
