I\'m severely going to miss him as he said he was retiring this year, I wish I had more opportunities to have him as a professor. Every class was inspirational, he just had such a way with words and teaching and every story he assigned was amazing. I actually found the homework and project and exams to be fun."

He quizzes on the most tiniest details in the reading, so you have to read SUPER carefully and remember everything word for word. His essays were easy and surprisingly fun to write. He lets you revise 3 essays for a grade higher. His research paper on Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad was a pain, but really interesting novel."
