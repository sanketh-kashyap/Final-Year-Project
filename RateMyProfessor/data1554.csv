His test are tricky sometimes but you have to think. Understanding and caring about what goes on in class. Go to class, not only will learn a lot but will help your grade a lot."

His passion for healthy lifestyles, laid-back approach to learning, and his unique ability to really bring a lot of value to health topics are awesome. If you need a health or pe class, as long as you show that you have interest in trying to be healthy, you have an A. Thank you MR G!!"
