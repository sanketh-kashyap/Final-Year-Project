Expects everyone in the class to be a professional artist. Does NOT acknowledge less talented students despite all the effort they put into something.

He expects way more time on each piece than the other teachers in the subject, grades really harshly, and won\'t hesitate to make you cry in front of everyone. BUT my drawing improved so much each week that I can\'t even recognize my work from the first week. If you can commit, this class is amazing"

If you didn\'t do a project exactly how he wants it, he\'ll chew you out and degrade your art for 10-15 minutes in front of the class (yes this happens on multiple occasions).

Its a studio class so that means about 8-12 hours of drawing HW per week.If your lazy, leave this class and dropout of college. If you want to learn to draw, HE\'s your guy. Not an easy A.

He helps students that are genuinely putting effort into learning what material is being taught, but that doesn\'t stop you from finding your own style/subject in the drawing class. No bull kind of teacher, and really does care for students and their work."

Getting a good critique from him his hard because he wants you to ask him the questions you have about your drawing. He doesn\'t just tell you what you need to do to help your drawing.
