Sarah  Lederstein,Brooklyn College,Computer Science department, Brooklyn, NY,0,5.0,N/A,1.0,,1,01/29/2009,CISMTH8,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Lederstein is a really nice professor. She is really sweet and the class is such a breeze. The test can be somewhat confusing but she doesn\'t count them against you if you fail. She assigns projects which are SUPER easy. I highly recommend her.
