He\'s extremely passionate about this course and goes off topic a lot. But he\'s very clear on what he will be testing you on. His tests are based off his powerpoints and anything he adds to them in lecture. Put the effort into studying and you will do well. Drops your lowest test grade as well.

His lectures are clear and precise, he genuinely cares about every student and he is accessible & accomodating.

The course is inherently difficult, but he will clarify a lot on the slides within lecture. Even though lecture is optional, those who do not attend will have lower grades than those who do.
