Super friendly and understanding. Willing to work one/one with people who are struggling. I\'ve heard people have labeled her a ""reverse ****"" but all I can do is laugh at that."

She does a good job of explaing the material to the best of her ability. I had her for ethics. She digs deep into her subject and it can be difficult to grasp at times but her officer hours are always available for further clarity. She is very specific on what she expects and is fair. I give her a 8/10
