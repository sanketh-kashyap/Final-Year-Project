TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"Evelyn Maeder was by far the coolest Criminology professor I\'ve ever had. The readings are long and dull, but not completely necessary to pass the class. It was a 40/60 split, midterm & final. Very important to attend class and take extensive notes in order to do well. She does an awesome job explaining course material but goes super quickly."

Expect to put the time and effort in, and you\'ll get a lot out of her class. She\'s very helpful and understanding; relates the class material well to the real world. Participation is a must though if you want to do well. I would welcome the opportunity to take another class from her and I\'ve taken 3."

She just doesn\'t get it, the mandatory assignments randomly and the pop quizzes have no benefits, they just bring down our grade. She teaches well, but is clueless on evaluations. Helpful and willing to help, but needs to learn how to give proper evalations."

I took Research Methods with her in 3rd yr and immediately searched for 4th yr classes she taught. She is great at explaining the material and breaking down the work to ensure students\' success. I always looked forward to her class. And this is coming from someone who previously hated research methods, math, etc. 1 of the best profs!"

Has trouble putting slides up on time. Doesn\'t related the course to any current news or events. Class is boring and doesn\'t go into detail, veryy TEXTBOOK focused. In-class assignments are mind-numbing, Tests are easy if you know the definitions."

Even when you tell her at the start of the course that you will be away, she refuses to acknowledge honesty and only wants a doctor\'s note. Slides aren\'t detailed and she speaks too fast to write decent notes. Her inclass assignments teach little about the content."

Take this class!!

Witty, charming, and not condescending at all. Really helps break down difficult concepts for non-psych concentration people. Still, she\'s a hard (but fair) marker so don\'t expect a good mark if you\'re lazy."

I have only been in one of her classes, and I wish I had taken more throughout my undergrad. She speaks clearly and is easy to understand. At first glance, she expects a lot-but any fourth year class does. Evelyn is very approachable and easy to talk too. I have nothing but good things to say about her!"

Her classes are mandatory because of in-class assignments. Her exams are a bit difficult, so be sure to also study the coursepack. Her lecture slides are not as important as what she says in lectures so..attend the lectures! Again, great prof."
