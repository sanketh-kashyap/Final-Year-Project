Reading the textbook helps, duh. You will absolutely do well if you\'ve already taken chemistry in high school. His tests are always the same format and very predictable and mostly simple."

I asked questions and showed up to every class, so he took pity on my awful material mastery. He\'s a wonderful teacher, goes pretty fast, and is very kind and compassionate if you prove you\'re working hard. But if you\'re not a science major, still tough"

His class lectures were long but he tried to cram so much information into like 1 hour 15 minute period that it was overwhelming! Multiple choice is hard but open response was fine. Do well in your Chem lab, it\'s worth 30% and can save you after bad exams!!"

He\'s as straight forward as he can be and always directly asks the class ""are there any questions?"" before moving on. His tests are challenging, but extremely fair. The class overall was tough, but more so because of the nature of NMR and less as a reflection of Lazo. Overall, a quality teacher."

He curves the class, which helps everyone. Tests are not difficult because he gives you a copy of last years exam. He can sometimes go a bit fast or not be very clear, so supplementing with the textbook is good."

Of course it helps to do the reading and work he assigns, but he\'s very thorough in class so you don\'t have to go over every detail. Tests are really easy"
