But when it comes to his teaching skills. It ain\'t the best. I\'ve passed all of my math classes with either an A or B. Professor McCann is not clear during lectures, & most of the time he doesn\'t come prepared. He just spends about 15min per section and does a couple of examples, then moves on to the next section."

He briefly reviews the material, so you need to study all by yourself. Just take ""online class"" that\'s better. Most of the class time, he just wants to answer students\' questions and complains that students are not working hard enough. Some students silently do their homework during class. ""AVOID HIS CLASSES!!!"""

I opened up an account to specifically tell you to not take his class. He does not go over the material, you will have to teach yourself.

I am a straight A student but failed his class. I missed the withdrawal date and just gave up and stopped attending. Assigns too much homework and not enough time to complete tests.

He required 800-900 homework questions per chapter worth only 10 points; the first two weeks of class it\'s optional then during our first exam he states he will minus 5 points if half done and drop a full grade if you did not do it at all; no credit for the half that you did.

The material itself was a little difficult but he\'ll help you if you ask for it. Lots of homework, but it\'s good practice. Hard to get +10 on homework because you have to do the unassigned even problems to get +10 added to your test score. If you do all the homework, it\'s +8 to test score.
