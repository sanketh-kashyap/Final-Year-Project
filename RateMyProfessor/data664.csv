I love how she acts like one of the students. I had her for comm150 last sem,and i managed to get out of her class with an A =). Ive always hated speech but her class is super easy. Attendance is not mandatory but there are unannounced quizzes. Mostly group work. Recommended prof! =)"

You do not really need to attend class, but the quizzes she gives are unannounced. Her lectures are straight out of the book, if you read, I would say an A is guaranteed. She grades really easily, she gives everyone a B+ to an A for all her assignments"

Many will dislike this class because she turned a college level class into a elementary school disciplined class. She is not an easy A. If you receive her please drop as soon as possible and sign up for another Comm.

Her class reminded me of middle school because any opportunity she found to incorporate arts in crafts into her lesson plan should would jump on it. Attendance is mandatory, -20 points every time you aren\'t present. If you read the chapters on which the quizzes are based, you\'ll get an A"

I didn\'t have any trouble in this class. Her reading quizzes are nothing if you read the chapters. She even lets you know what pages to read.

She doesn\'t know how to engage the class and i felt like i was back in 5th grade drawing my name on a card and drawing my ""favorite things"" on it."

She is EXACTLY what a teacher should be. She actually cares about teaching and her students. She made my most dreaded class really interesting and enjoyable. If you can get in her class, I really suggest it."
