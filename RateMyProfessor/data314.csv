Jerome  Quarterman,Howard University,Management department, Washington, DC,2,4.5,N/A,2.0,,5,11/19/2012,HHPLS141,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I\'ve had Quarterman for 2 years now. His class is probably the most entertaining class I\'ve had at Howard. He always seems to have an amazing story about his life and its relation to whatever we may be discussing at the time. His class is more of a lecture but once every week we are required to complete an assignment. He is Joy! take this class!

He literally takes you by the hand and it is really easy to get an A! A paper or two a week that discusses your opinion on the subject matter! He is very organized! Take this class!!! I enjoyed every minute of his class and hated when I was late because I\'d missed a great conversation

He takes his timeout teach students about life and how ethics relate to our lives. Honestly I recommend students to take his class before they graduate from Howard. Dr. Quarterman class is not hard and all you is turn in all your assignments on time to get an A in the class.

He\'s older so a lot of his comments are off the wall or irrelevant. He is very picky on writing. He likes things done the same way each and every time. To get an A in his class, simply attend, and do all assignments in the correct format!"
