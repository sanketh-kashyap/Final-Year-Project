I felt like I was flying with a friend rather than a CFI. She kept me going, even through the roughest parts of training. She is amazing and I wish I still had her for my Instrument course. Best one to have, be excited if you have Doskow!"

She wants you to know everything about flying which is reasonable. She is a great pilot, but she wants you to fly as good as she does. Cute to look at, but difficult to keep a friendly conversation with while taking about something other than flying."

Wish I could keep her for my 221 course."
