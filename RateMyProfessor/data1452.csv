She really cares about how well you do in class so she\'ll try to push you. One slogan she often uses is ""wiggle it out"" right before you give a presentation to shake off the nervousness. Shes young, pretty, helpful, and be sure to do the readings for some quizzes."

Not a tough grader on presentations, tougher on the outlines though. Do take though because she\'s nicer than most of the other T.A.\'s for sure."

Takes interest in her students and relateable. Loved this class even though I wasn\'t thrilled about giving speeches, she made it fun, gave tons of help and constructive criticism, gives you what you need to succeed. I went from getting C\'s ro A\'s on my last two speeches, she\'s a great teacher, take her."

She grades kind of strictly but she teaches you the material so it\'s not too hard.
