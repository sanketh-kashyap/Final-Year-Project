He is funny, a pleasure to be around and overall a chill professor. He grades fairly and offers help if needed. With that said this class won\'t be a breeze, you have to put the effort in but he is worth it. His teaching methods work, I stayed interested through out the class.

I hate history classes but his animation, jokes and ability to explain information was awesome. He does not mince words and is very honest about what he thinks and what happened in history-no sugar coating here. He is fun and a fair grader.

He definetly knows his material and is not one sided teaching it at all. Makes an effort to involve students and incorporate material into modern references. He definetly makes you think about the material and is very lenient with material. No real homework, gives papers way in advance, and is very helpful."
