He tries to make sure everyone is on the same page and will go over topics if you don\'t understand. If you just do the stuffs he tells you to do then its an easy A. Just go over the problems he specifically tells you in class or does in blackboard. Those problems are 95% going to be on the test.

I always knew what to expect on the tests and quizzes & he gave a formula sheet with ALL the formulas & constants. Everyone did poorly on an exam so he gave a retake of it. However, I took it over the summer & had a class size of 15 so that could effect his teaching style"

His testing does not corresponding with the content in the textbook. His lectures are entirely unhelpful. And on top of everything he is a very cheap grader who doesn\'t curve. I have discovered that no amount of preparation will ensure an A on his exams. Avoid at all costs.

No explanations during lectures, no clarity, calculus-based handouts posted on Blackboard, ZERO guidance and the midterms do NOT reflect what you will learn on your own from the textbook.

Overall is a fair teacher but you must do lots of outside work and studying on top of going to class and doing the homework to do well (unless you are naturally good at physics). Quizzes were pretty easy since they were similar to the homework but the exams were tricky and a lot tougher.

So go over all the problems he suggests because most likely those will be quiz and exam questions. Sometimes it is hard to understand him but he is willing to help you during his office hours.
