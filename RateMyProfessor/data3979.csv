However, organization of the course is non-existent and discussion frequently wanders away from the point. Basically, I did not feel like I was getting my money\'s worth with this course."

I skipped class a lot and all you do is the same stuff everyday. It did not matter if I went to class or not. I knew what he talked about and what was for homework.

Incredibly entertaining stories, use of books rather than textbooks, and a sincere desire to teach effectively make every single one of his classes worthwhile. Take his classes and change your perspective on capitalism forever! : )"
