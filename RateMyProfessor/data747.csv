You\'ll need 3 books for this class (Workbook, Charters book & textbook).She gives out about 12 quizzes through out the semester & drops 2 of the lowest scores. 5 exams & offers about 2 extra credits."

Perhaps an online class is better. However, she can be lenient on certain things. You\'ll just have to talk to her. Main projects: PowerPoints, 1000 word essay, and video. There are oral tests too."

You will have to complete a Powerpoint of the 5 lessons you will be taught, do a group video, and a three page essay. She makes you interact with your classmates with lot of role playing which makes Chinese fun."

As long as you keep up with the work that is assigned and review the material this class will be pretty easy. Not a hard class, just very confusing because she\'s not the most organized teacher."
