I thoroughly enjoyed his course, and looked forward to class. He is an outstanding professor with a vast wealth of knowledge, and stories. He teaches with enthusiasm, and passion. Encourages class participation, and always allows for questions. Open, laid back learning environment."

As someone who is interested in cultural anthropology, I was highly disappointed. I can\'t imagine what it must be like to not even want to take this class. Weekly quizzes only 5 questions. 4/5 on most quizzes = 80 in the class,essentially."

Most of your grade is based on weekly reading quizzes, five questions mostly on the bolded vocab and exams are basically an accumulation of this. He rambles and re-tells stories but overall its an easy A."

No mandatory attendance though. Exams are multiple choice and true false. Very detailed. A book paper and field trip paper. If you study for his tests, you can get a good grade. Puts his lectures online. He goes too fast in class so you can\'t write it down. Cool guy but sort of unreliable."

Nice guy, if you ask him for help he loves to talk about the course. Goes off on a lot of strange examples. Offers extra credit on midterms. Just know the vocab, and you\'ll be fine. I recommend this class for anyone who needs GE credit or if they want to take an anthropology class."

His tests are straight out of the book and his Powerpoints. Sometimes he pulls the most random examples, but it doesn\'t hurt your grade much because he curves the entire class at the end of the semester. Papers are easy. He goes off on random tangents a lot, lots of stories."

Goes off on tangeants that are sometimes pretty funny. Very easy class. Some questions on the tests are very specific though. But mostly, just read the book and you don\'t really even need to go to class."

He loves anthropology and wants his students to find interest in it as well. I would definately reccomend this class its easy just review the powerpoints and read the book."

Very easy class, recommend taking it if you need credits. Just read the summary in the back of each chapter and you should be fine"

Questions are unfair and tricky. He tends to go off on tangents and it is hard to know what is important. Coming to class is pointless (I did) because he goes through Power points way too fast. You basically have to teach yourself. DO NOT RECOMMEND! THIS CLASS WAS MISERABLE!

Very passionate about the course. Do the readings! He lectures off the book and does adds information that will be on tests so don\'t miss class either. The subject is not as exciting as you would think but he keeps it interesting with his personal stories.

But Prof Gross was fantastic! I wish he taught more than just archaeology and cultural anthropology! I think what made this class enjoyable for me were the stories about his travels, especially Egypt!"

But it is a really easy A. You don\'t even really to go to class unless there is a test, something is due, there is a film you need to do a paper on. We only had one pop quiz. The tests are pretty easy. As long as you read the book and memorize definitions you should be fine."
