I suggest using the Mastering Biology add-on she gives you. It definitely helps."

She is totally interested and willing to help if you need assistance but you have to ask, this isn\'t grade school. I enjoyed her class so much I am taking her for A&P II. Gives quizzes every class and they are helpful. She has strict grading policies but is fair."

She gives a quiz basically every class, unless you are taking a test. If you just listen to her in class, you probably won\'t do good, but if you reread the chapters and basically ""teach"" yourself, then you will do good. But I wouldn\'t recommend her!"
