You don\'t want to miss class because in every lecture she goes over important material. Take good notes, go to class, and you will pass easily. I really didn\'t use the textbook at all. She goes over everything you need during lecture."

She cares deeply about the subject and helping her students succeed. She understands that a lot of students take Geology to fulfill a science requirement, so she knows not everyone is going to know a lot about the material prior to class. Work hard and go to class and you will be fine. She\'s wonderful."
