Only problem i had with her was the getting to class 1-2 min before the class begun i thought that was unprofessional and sometimes would be late.

She is very well prepared before a lesson, and if she encounters trouble, she will explain what she\'s doing and how she troubleshooted it. Very nice person, I would recommend her for an easy class where you learn a lot."
