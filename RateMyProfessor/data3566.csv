GET READY TO READ  TOUGH GRADER,1,4,"Ehsan demands a lot of work, he literally thinks his INT 201, is your only class. He gives you 2 projects and you have to work with other people and share information and this sucks cause at the end you have to rate people on the amount of work they gave you. He talks for hours and there is no discussion. Welcome to INT."

Ehsani is really good, he definitely knows a lot about every topic assigned. Get ready to read and participate ! However , the class itself isn\'t that hard but the final research will take a you a lot (15PGES), so you\'d better start thinking about it as soon as he gives you the different topics."

You will have to read in this class, no way around that. Classes are discussion based and you will be called on. Lots to write too. My papers were critiqued very well. You\'ll get a decent grade if you have a good thesis and meet the requirements."

It is tough work but it prepares you for the rest of your INT classes. I had a really tough quarter and he was so willing to help in any way he could but also pushed you to do your best. I wish I could take him for every INT class. He\'s brilliant.

He is without a doubt the smartest man I have ever met, and he will go out of his way to help every student. He does expect a A LOT, but it only makes you want to work that much harder for a good grade :)) Definitely take him!"

You will learn so much from him and feel inspired to push yourself extra hard to submit good work. He goes out of his way to engage all of his students. Take him as often as you can. Like the previous reviews said, he will literally change your life."

Although his class was the hardest class, I would still take his class again if I could. As long as you express your thoughts in class discussion, everything is fine. In my opinion, he sets the example of what a true professor should be."

He\'s one of the most intelligent professors I\'ve had and he\'s expects a *lot* from his students. His focal point class was the toughest I\'ve had but he\'s such a good professor, you want to work extra hard to submit good work. I worked hard and got an A."
