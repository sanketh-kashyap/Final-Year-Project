He definetely knows what he is talking about. You\'ll see a lot of people complain because they just want it to be easy, but it is a graduate class and no one should expect that. He is a good professor and tries to help you a lot."

However, if you have any questions or would like to go beyond the book\'s concepts, then you are on your own. Mont cannot answer questions outside of the book as well as questions inside the book."
