Lindsey  Jones,Clemson University,English department, Clemson, SC,2,3.8,N/A,3.4,,5,10/27/2011,ENGLI22,1.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Not a good English teacher. Too uppity and thinks she is better qualified than she actually is. Only the second worse english teacher I\'ve had because the worst one was moody and graded based off race. Would not take again, and you better hope you don\'t disagree with her... she doesn\'t like that."

I did the bare minimum and walked out of there just barely missing an A. I\'m terrible at English and I did fine. Shes cool, we had class outside a few times. Class is real open and easy to converse with her. and plus she is super hot!"

That first day when I walked in I knew I was in for the class of my life. I didn\'t do my homework, and my GPA went down, and she called me out in front of everybody every time I txt, but she didn\'t know I just wanted her to look at me. She always wears sweet shoes."

She gives you a lot of work to do but she is very clear about what she expects of you and your work. She is also a stickler about texting in class, if you do, she will take massive points off your participation grade and trust me, you will need those points. She is also a nice teacher to look at when bored in class."
