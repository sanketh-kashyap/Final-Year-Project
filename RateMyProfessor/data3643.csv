He is so caring about his students and really wants you to learn and to have the best experience possible. His lectures are really interesting and you learn a lot about the intricacies of the Spanish language as well as culture. There is a lot of hw but as long as you do the work you will be fine.

He is easy going, pretty funny, and engaging. He gets side tracked pretty easily if you talk about Colombia. If you are thinking about taking 201 over the winter, do it. The class is easy if you put in the work. I do not recommend taking this class without doing 102 or 103, or without prior experience, you won\'t do well."

Younger professor. Took him over winter and was expecting to struggle. He did a good job pacing the class and is very approachable and helpful. He made the class interesting and I left the class clearly understanding concepts that I struggled with earlier. Go to class, do the homework and assignments n youll be ok."

Having not taken Spanish since 4-5 years, I was worried that I would not get back on track. But the class was enjoyable and the material was easy to grasp if you read and do the HW. If you take his course you will surely enjoy it."

He understands what it\'s like being a student and doesn\'t overload the required work. He may seem unclear and difficult to understand. However, when he\'s teaching a comment if you\'re 100% honest with him and tell him you don\'t understand he\'ll slow it down and go over it until you do! Great professor!"

Attendance is mandatory and oral participation for in-class activities is required but the exams are based mostly on those activities so they help you. Just remember to do your homework/online assignments and you shouldn?t get lower than a B. Recommended!

He wants to help you if you\'re struggling but does not know how and will fail you if he thinks you\'re not ready for 201.
