Stays after class to help you if you need it. All tests, quizzes, and homework online. Voice somewhat monotone though. Somewhat has a different way of solving problems compared to the online homework."

Very monotone (I took him at 8am-- he didn\'t catch my attention). Nice guy though!"

If you go to class and do the homework you will be able to get a good grade. He goes over everything that is on the homework, tests, and quizzes in class."
