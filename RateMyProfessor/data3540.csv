What he goes over in class is exactly what your homework will be so do the homework while he goes over it so you will know how to do it. Homework isn\'t due for 2 weeks after he assigns it. Come to class, pay attention, do the work, and it\'s an A. He will make you feel stupid when you ask questions though. I liked his class"

He goes over the exercises in the book for 2 or 3 days, gives you a sheet with the homework (which is what he\'s spent class going over), and gives you the nest 2 or 3 class days to work on it, then you take the test. If you study the practice quizzes you will make an ""A."" That is where he takes all the test questions from."
