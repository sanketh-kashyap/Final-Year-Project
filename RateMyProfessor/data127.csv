Only two homework assignments which are exact to the short answers on the exams, and one current events paper. He will tell you to buy the textbook but you will never use it. He drops test questions that a lot of people got wrong. Gives detailed study guides for every exam; he really wants his students to succeed. Take him!"

Have to really work for this class on your own. The professor is very fair, however, it is very hard to understand why he grades your writing one way and someone else\'s another. I didn\'t think he was that bad of a professor, however, I would not recommend taking him if you can avoid."

The class is extremely unclear and two tests are weighed for a combined total of 80%.(MT and Final) He tries to help, but his exams are unclear and so are his exam reviews. I would try to take a different professor. There are some students in the class who may actually end up with C\'s. AVOID"

He also takes it into consideration when giving you a final grade if you go it office hours / seek extra help.
