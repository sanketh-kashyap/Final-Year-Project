Just make sure to do your work by the deadline and you should be fine you read a chapter and take a quiz on it there is no midterm or no final. Just quizzes that are easy once a week after you read a chapter you take a quiz and do a discussion."

There is a test per chapter (14) and most of them go with a discussion about the chapter. There are also three speeches where you would have to record yourself and upload the videos. I highly recommend this class if you are a person that can follow up without any supervision.

You will have several speech outlines and videos to upload to she is very lenient. I highly recomment her and her class.

The first day I took her she was full of energy, and even when the semester is almost over(where I am now) she STILL has all that energy. Her speeches are REALLY easy and she doesn\'t grade you harshly. If you need to get that credit for speech take her. Btw I like the fact that she doesn\'t use the book until the end =P"
