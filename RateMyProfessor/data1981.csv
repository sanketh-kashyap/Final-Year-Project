Works with you outside of class and tries his best to help you understand. Very smart. He also allows you to rework your milestones of you rproject (for averaged credit). The project is the main part of your grade and is hard but doable. This teacher is a must for CIS majors. I hope GSU picks this guy up full time

Allows redos on milestones for averaged credit. Large group project which is a large part of your grade. Really cool guy and he will work with you outside of class. He didn\'t win a teaching award for nothing. :-). A must take for cis majors.
