But the class itself is great! Found the material really interesting and the professor really knows her stuff!"

It was an online course with a essay due every wk from 3-4 readings, plus respond with at least 2 para. to 3 students work. I wonder if she thought this was the only class we had. I dropped her class within 2wks. I guess she thought she would give us lots since"

She really knows what she\'s talking about! This class wasn\'t easy but it was rewarding. I learned so much from it and recommend it. It made me decide to take a Latin American Studies minor and changed the way I view Latin America.

I took it for a GE and because it fit into my work schedule. But I was surprised by how interesting the material and class was. If you don\'t keep up with assignments or reading, you\'ll be lost. Just do your work and she\'s no prob."

If you don\'t keep up with the reading your screwed. You also have a paper due almost every week. This class feels more like a writing class."

Be prepared to know exactly what is in the readings for the quizzes. She may seem hard but if your paying attention and doing what you have to do then you will be okay. :)

Every week we had 4-5 articles to read or 3ish chapters from the book. She does ask up nd has cut it down some. We have to write a 500 word essy on what we read and post on blackboard. No midterm and mabe no final. Shes a good teacher and def interesting, but alot of reading"

Her class requires a lot of work and is far from an easy A. If you care and want to learn about Latin America, take her class. If you just want a relaxing course with little work, I would take someone else."

The class is lots of work, but you learn so much and the material is interesting. I consider the class a base for all of my future studies because I know how to analyze what I read. There\'s lots of readings, but you just learn how to skim. Not hard, turn in ALL your papers and go to class."
