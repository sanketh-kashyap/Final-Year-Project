His approach is more about ""open support"" than it is about ""whipping you into shape,"" which has its pros and cons. Workshop discussion can be lackluster since proof that you critiqued your peers\' work isn\'t required."

Very shy and quiet."

If that doesn\'t motivate you enough to be on your best behaviour in class and work hard, here\'s more. He\'s patient, very encouraging, isn\'t that annoying art and poetry lover that wants to force it on you , or change your life or be partial towards those that are like that."

His workshop based class is always lively and helpful- his input and classmates\' input really helps revise your poems and exposes you to different poetry styles. Really enjoyed this class!"

It was my best class of the semester, and I would DEF take him again. He\'s friendly, easy to understand, but still makes the class a challenge. Takes reading quizzes to make sure you read the book, but otherwise AWESOME."
