Ling Liu was the most helpful accounting teacher I\'ve ever had. She goes a little fast because there\'s a lot of info to cover but she always waits for questions after teaching. Ask questions! Few HW assignments, Exam heavy grader."

The professor is very knowledgeable but I had difficulty understanding her. She was always willing to help clear up any questions but you have to be willing to make the time to go see her or ask questions in class.

Professor is more than willing to help students and is very helpful when you ask questions. Personally I never listened to lectures or took notes and just read the book and taught myself how to do the assignments. Lectures sometimes seemed directionless. Overall good class.
