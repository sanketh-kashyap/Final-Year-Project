Classes do not have structure and grading system is often changed without notifying students. Do NOT take this course with this professor if you have any interest in the subject whatsoever.

But for me, I didn\'t care about that sort of thing, in fact, I love it when things are not so rigid -- and Sanjay made it so that he could teach according to what the class needed to learn, rather than forcing things on us. I loved his teaching style, and loved the class."

He is unorganized and his explanations are quite unclear. But he is the most helpful prof if you go ask him personally. He also got good character too!

If you crave structure in the course, it is definately not fun because he isn\'t consistent with what is outlined in the course syllabus...and sort of changes his mind on the go which can get frusturating. Overall, its not a terrible course though."

Really fun and easy course. But he is very unorganized and confusing. He has an old-school way of teaching and changes his mind constantly. But it is easy to get an A in his class. You just have to ask him for clarifications and make sure you talk to him bout term ppr. also, he grades discussions so speak up"

Engages the class with stories and fun tidbits. But if you can\'t handle spontaneity and creativity within the structure this prof isn\'t for you. If you\'re in it for that actual materials and learning though, this prof knows his stuff."

He handed out a course outline at the begining of the term, and now with 2 weeks of the course left, he decided to change the grading scheme and abitrarily assign grades...stay away from this prof!!"
