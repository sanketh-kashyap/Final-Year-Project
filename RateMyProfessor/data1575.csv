Take him you\'ll love how he teaches, what to expect on his lecture exams and show you some simple methods that you\'ll like. He does write all over the board but boy does he teach well. I recommend yall take him . If he teached chem 131 I would\'ve taken him but unfortunately he doesn\'t"

But after the course was over, I learned to LOVE him! He is fast, yes. And he does write all over the board, BUT he DOES teach and explains things well. He taught us tricks and methods that really help for CHEM131. I wish he taught all my future chem courses. I would DEF recommend Prof. Banerjee for chem!"

Not a clear direct format when he teaches either he just scribbles all over the white board.U have 2 options either you decide to listen only or copy what he writes down which dont even make sense what ur copying. hes nice though,personality wise. funny too with his accent. but personally I dont recommend him"

He is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and better yet, he knows how to explain it so that anyone can understand it...and enjoy it. It\'s a class that many people may have to take if they haven\'t taken Chem in a few years. If its mando, might as well take it with him!!!"

I\'ve moved on the Chem 101 and I feel like I don\'t know anything I should. He doesn\'t know how to teach, but you can tell he\'s very passionate about chemistry. The tests are essentially the same as the practice tests he gives you. If you just need an easy A, take him, if you need to learn, don\'t"
