Laura  Dickinson,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,2,3.8,N/A,4.5,,2,02/10/2011,LAW709,2.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I took this class because it sounded like the most entertaining and easy electives to take 1L year... WRONG. Sure she seems like a nice person, but LOTS of reading assignments!! Typically 100+ pages per class. Cold calls, ridiculous questions, useless information. (And I\'m even top 20%). I have never dreaded going to a class more in law school."

Very helpful, always willing to answer questions, and never looked down on a student who didn\'t know the answer. The class was really interesting and I learned a lot."
