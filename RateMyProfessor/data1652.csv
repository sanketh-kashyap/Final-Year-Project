She is always willing to explain and is available when needed. The material is not easy. Studying is MANDATORY. Workload is decent.

I am currently struggling in her class at failing mark, she teaches way to fast and is note reliant. I\'m currently taking intro to Chem and this is REALLY in depth compared to other classes. She hates cell phones and treats us like children. Just avoid her class."

She does go through some of the work fast, but it is easy to print her powerpoints out prior to class. She is always willing to help, give examples, and answer questions. She is really nice, too. I am a full time student and found her workload to be reasonable. Just pay attention in class and read."

Yes she may go fast but she explains everything so well, there has not been one concept i haven\'t understood yet! She always takes the time to help you if you need it and her tutoring door is always open! I will suggest her to anyone!"

Her tests were over enormous amounts of material and were incredibly difficult. She explains things fairly well, bur still, avoid her if you can. Avoid, avoid, avoid."

Goes thru the material way too fast and continues even if you don\'t understand. Attendance is mandatory in her class and cell phones are a huge NO, NO in her class."
