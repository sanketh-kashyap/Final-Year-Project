Instead you work on your own in the book, which is only online, and pretty much look up the answers. The work isn\'t hard, just annoying. Having an instructor who actually showed you how to do things would help."

Program used is flawed and confusing.

I really like how he spends plenty of time going over programming examples during the class. He\'s also very clear about what he expects in homework and very organized. If only he taught the Web design classes too!"

He helps you with whatever you need. He is very lenient with classwork as long as you dont take advantage of him. He lets you skip class if you work ahead. I already knew some stuff about computers so it wasnt very hard for me, but the students who didnt know so much usually got a good grade and understood the work if they tried."
