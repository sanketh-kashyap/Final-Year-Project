YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,Ms. Leighton is very friendly and actively works to ensure that the class understands the subject material. It was rare that I had a difficult time grasping the concept of many of the codes and standards that we would go over. The way the class was presented was also very helpful as everyone is required to participate and speak.

RESPECTED,0,0,"Mrs. Leighton is a tough but fair teacher. She has everything well prepared and you know right wats expected of you. OSHA is a dry subject, but she makes it interesting with research projects and reports. Participation earns you points, if you take advantage of it. Nobody can hide in this class. She calls it active learning. We like her."

She uses color powerpoints that illuminate the subject of Multisim CAD and Ultiboard Printed Circuit Board design. She is obviously artistic, and a technical expert. What is great is that she makes you better too, and does not talk down to you--encouraging."
