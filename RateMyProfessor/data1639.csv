I still remember her as the best English professor/teacher I\'ve ever had, and certainly one of the best professors I\'ve ever had. Three years later, and I thought I\'d do a review. I suppose that says something."

If you just do what she asks, you will excel. Homework matters in this class, so if you slack in this area, you will find yourself in trouble. She\'s not great with technology, so don\'t expect lots of videos. She will offer help outside of class, which really helps."

The class over all wasn\'t that fun, there were alot of essays to write one after the other. She puts her students first and is willing to do just about anything to help you. I really recommend her."
