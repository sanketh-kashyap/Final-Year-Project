Yes, he\'s tough and makes you memorize the DSM but it\'s grad school, we need professors that\'ll make us work hard the way he does. The class will be a struggle but you\'ll come out of it with knowledge and will be prepared to be a competent psychologist."

He knows his stuff and does a great job at explaining the material. I suggest those that take his class pay attention and take advantage of the wealth of information this man has to offer. He\'s also quite witty, which makes his classes much more entertaining. I personally look forward to class each week!"

(He is a walking encyclopedia!) Yes, his classes are hard? But come on, this is a doctorate program, what are you expecting? I had Dr. Cunliffe for psychopath II, and I still remember all the criteria?"

He is definitely one of the best CAU has to offer. His forensic classes are amazing. I really look forward to going to class each week. Those who complain are plain lazy or just can\'t hack it and have no business being in a doctoral program."

Test construction is another story. I guess because he loves the subject, he is extremely critical of students answers, which are part essays. His questions are difficult to understand and if doesn\'t like your answer, you will not get any points. Do not take this class until you can dedicate all your time to it."

He is indeed fair and challenges students to reach their full potential. Those who complain have no business being in graduate school. This is not high school nor undergrad. We are there to become doctors and we should have the knowledge we need to become competent doctors.

The exams have 50 MC questions and 1 vignette that we must show a differential diagnosis. His TA for the class is very helpful and I strongly recommend seeing him at least 1x. If you study, there is no reason you shouldn\'t get a B. He is a little funny too. Just study hard."

He is certainly well versed and has much to offer. He is one of the best professors at CAU. For those that are complaining...graduate school is not supposed to be easy. If it were, I would definitely question why? For the cost of tuition, we should have more dilligent professors like Dr. Cunliffe."

He favors students and fails ones who do not sit in front kissing butt. He doe not grade fairly. He is smart, but uses this too his advantage and demands to much and gives so much hard work.
