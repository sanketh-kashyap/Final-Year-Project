Do the assignments, it\'s basically free points. The essays were not extremely tough to do; I think most people procrastinated on them. This teacher was very involved and gave great feedback on essays. It was my first 4.0 in an English class."

Show up, try hard, and do the work and you\'ll be fine. He\'s not going to hand out 4.0\'s just because you came to class. I got a 4.0, it was tough but far from impossible. Use the feedback both he and your peers give and adjust your papers accordingly."

It can be almost impossible to get 100% on papers, but that can be good because he really makes you try your best. Gives great feedback and has a lot of enthusiasm."

Takes his work very serious and pushes actors for greatness. Pushs people out of their comfort zone and ends up with a great end result. Also incredibally attractive on a daily basis.

For in-class written assignments I was docked points for not arguing Marxist theories; I didn\'t know that was a prerequisite for this class. A bit loquacious for my liking, especially when 90% of the class is just out of high school."
