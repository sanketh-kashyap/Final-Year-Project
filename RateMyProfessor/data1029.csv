David  Gruber,Bard College,Not Specified department, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY,0,3.6,N/A,2.8,,4,12/14/2009,FYSEMDG,2.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Gruber is ok. His Fysem class wasn\'t bad and he wasn\'t too tough of a teacher. Not a great class but not a good on either. If you want an easy class this could be the class for you.

I still really have no idea what he wants from papers, even after seeing him after class a few times during the semester. He was eager to help, but he doesn\'t really know what he wants, so he couldn\'t really help all that much."

While he doesn\'t absolutely pile on the reading, his class moves at a steady pace, and his discussions are always engaging. He\'s especially good at encouraging and facilitating participation, and his papers, while difficult, are often rewarding and graded clearly and methodically. Strict but caring. Very good."
