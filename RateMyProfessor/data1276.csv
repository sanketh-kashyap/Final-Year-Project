I enjoyed taking Mr. Scanlan\'s class although the topic is not something I usually enjoy. He provided plenty of resources and his class was work at your own pace, which I really liked. I didn\'t feel like there was a lot of home work despite some other reviews."

Welcomes questions. Homework given approx once biweekly) Tests are 33 questions (less than 10 mathematical) and a bonus question. Equation sheets provided for each exam so don\'t memorize formulas (only know what they mean: V velocity) Lectures in class but he records & uploads lectures to mycourses. Highly recommended!

He does a wonderful job explaining the material very clearly and provides a ton of material to help students do well. He records every lecture and uploads it onto mycourses. He provides videos with examples which are almost exactly the same problems you encounter on the exam. Learn the concepts and you will do great.
