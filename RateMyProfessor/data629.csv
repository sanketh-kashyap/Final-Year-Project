The course overall is difficult because a lot of information is thrown at you and students can be easily confused and lost. The professor gives a review before the exam but sometimes the questions on the exam are more confusing than the review sheet.

He gives you all of the information you need to know in class, but that doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t read the text.
