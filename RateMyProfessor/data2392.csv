There is homework, but it is online and doesn\'t take long. His tests are not too hard, either. I\'d definitely recommend him. Not to mention, he is GORGEOUS, which is a good incentive for going to class."

I took 098, 099, & 1111 with him & got 100 on all. He is simply awesome. He is very polite & friendly. He\'s always available to help. I used to hate math, but because of his great way of teaching, math is now my favorite subject. I wish he teaches all math classes. HATS OFF TO MR. HIPPCHEN!!"

He is very young, and can relate to many of the students. For me, he could be my kid, no not so much!! But he is a great teacher. He tries hard to relay the info so everyone will get it. He will review and help. You can go to more classes of his if you need to. No curves or bumps. Great class! LET HIM TEACH 1113 and higher!!"
