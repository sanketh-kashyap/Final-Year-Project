PLEASE take her! She makes history so interesting and teaches it in a way you\'ll retain it. The tests are easy if you pay attention and study. She also gives you the option to not take the last test if you pass the first 2. There is also one paper that you can decide what to write about. One word, great."

She covers a lot of material in a short period of time, but as long as you take good notes and use he study guide you\'ll be fine.
