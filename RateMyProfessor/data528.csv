You do not need a textbook and there are no tests. I would recommend this professor."

The class is pretty easy. It\'s hard to hate her because she\'s so nice but the class itself is really boring. It\'s hard getting the motivation to get to class because the lectures are rather boring but overall it\'s a decent class and pretty easy.
