There is a semester project also, it\'s a bit overwhelming but not too much. Exams aren\'t hard and usually open book."

You need to work for it. A LOT of online homework which can be the main way you learn and can make or break your grade. Online work is a must do! Right in the middle of the semester he will switch to all spanish and sometimes you will have no idea what he is saying. Will say he is pretty easy on the eyes though.

I am currently taking all the Spanish classes with him. only down side is if you do not like doing internet activities then this class is not for you. but if you don\'t mind then take it. this teacher is fair and understanding of what a student goes though and helps out when possible.

He didn\'t grade fairly, he acted as though he didn\'t recieve any papers I gave him and marked me absent even though I was there. He expects everyone to know spanish. Bad professor"
