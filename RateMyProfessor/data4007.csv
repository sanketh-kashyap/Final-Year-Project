This class is not hard. Go to lab and lecture. Take notes. Use her study guide. She does give A LOT of little assignments, but not a difficult class."

She makes you do so many little projects that take A LOT of effort and they\'re only worth like 5 or 10 pts. If you\'re lazy DO NOT TAKE. In order to do well you must do all of your work and study hard for the tests. You will need to read your book and notes in order to pass tests."

She wont round your grade if it\'s a 79.4. lol. She is sweet, but I do not reccomend her. Plus she makes you watch that Al Gore film on global warming."

She\'s scattered, holds you over in class and lab, tests were hard. I ended up having to drop the class before a failed. Don\'t waste your time with her."
