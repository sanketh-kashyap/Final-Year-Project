He did not seem to want to be there which made going to the class difficult. All his powerpoints were straight from the textbook so he seemed to have little knowledge about the actual subject and spoke very vaguely. He does not give much work but he also does not know how to engage the class by any means.

He does want his students to succeed. Used Powerpoints and tried to engage the class,but he seems kind of introverted. The class is easy if you read the book and study. 4 multiple choice tests (40 questions), one paper,and one group presentation. Was not a difficult A."

He did not seem to know his subject matter whatsoever and seemed to be annoyed by having to teach the class. I did get an A in his class but believed I could have learned more myself by just reading pscyh books. He is a grad student and you can tell he does not want to teach. I learned nothing from him.
