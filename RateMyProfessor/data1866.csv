YOU WON\'T PASS.,1,0,"i took this teacher at City tech and at first i wasn\'t feeling her, she\'s old and talks a bit slow.. but the class is really interesting, take good notes because she gives a few quizzes, but all multiple choice. her tests are 51 multiple choice questions and she gives three easy essays. Barely uses the textbook, i would take her again."

She creates a mess on the board, mixing all the terms and definitions and gives nothing in the exam related to what she teaches in the class. Her exams are very hard and long.

She is very condescending almost to the point of belittlement. Very mean...She only teaches from book and very boring. If you want a good prof. take Dr. Marcus you will learn something from him. Her class is like being in Highs
