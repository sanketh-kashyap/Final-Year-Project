The hw is VERY similar to the tests though, so make sure you do it! He\'s truly passionate about math, but understands that not everyone loves it as much as he does. Take him!"

He\'s truly passionate about math. I LOVED his class, he made 75 minutes fly by(although I usually hate math). Only issue is that he sometimes moved too fast, but overall he was very clear and helpful. Doesn\'t just want his students to memorize steps but to understand the material. Gives credit where it\'s deserved."

Calculus has proven to be an intensely difficult course, but he makes it manageable. he gives out note packets that you do, in full, in class and the tests are exactly like to them, and the optional homework. Take him."

One problem winds up being 20 points which if you get wrong will bring down your grade on that test dramatically. Talks to you like your a 5 year old. The class is very easy but the way he makes his tests are so hard that its not even worth taking.
