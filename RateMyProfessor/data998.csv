Extremely knowledgeable, though she teaches tough, she makes it easy to listen and learn. She brings real world projects to her classroom and is willing to go the extra mile for her students to succeed. I am going to take every class she offers, no other teacher can compare."

There\'s no way to express her dedication to teaching and her willingness to help. Take her, don\'t think about taking anyone else because you will regret it."

I highly recommend taking a welding class with her instead of Figg since she seems much more committed.
