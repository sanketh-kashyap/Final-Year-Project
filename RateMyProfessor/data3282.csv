Attendance grades didn\'t matter as long as you printed the PPT notes, studied them, and did well on the tests. The man calling himself an anthropologist is a laugh, though. Mission trips do not equal studying a culture, you are Converting them."

It was obvious after 20 min of class what his personal beliefs are, and they heavily tinted the way class was taught. If you did not agree with him, you were simply Wrong. He did not teach what may be, he taught what He believed, and darn all else pretty much. I did NOT like this class, but made an A"

Class is easy to pass as long as you attend class to get attendance points. If you print off ppt and take notes its a much easier class. Gives EVERY single question day before test. There are 5 500 word papers to write that are super easy. Overall a good teacher that has good tastes in 3 piece suits.

If you are there for lectures you should do okay, he does power point and textbook."
