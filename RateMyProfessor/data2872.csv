As a senior this class was useless. Also, classes are not worth attending because all the quizzes are take-home. Jim schilling is very condescending and talks to students like they are in 2nd grade. This class was unbearingly hard to attend."

Too easy. He talks a lot about athletic training and why you should choose that major, but the thought of having other classes with him disgusted me."

He is very knowledgable about athletic training. I had him for Intro. to Sports Medicine. Class is very easy and mostly consists of speakers talking to the class. Two papers and maybe 5 take home quizzes and a take home Final! Easy A for this class.

He talks with every student like nothing else is around. He is so focused on what people have to say. He spent a lot of time just chatting with me about how I felt about the class! Let alone the time he spent with me working on some of the material.
