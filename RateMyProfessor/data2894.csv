Very helpful and understanding. We never used our book and he usually gave us a review of what was on the test the day before. Very good looking =)

He makes class fun-you never do the same thing twice. Uses videos and class activities a lot for teaching, and tells you what is going to be on tests. Very little writing assignments. Everything is easy to understand and he is willing to help. Prefers that students are always in class an on time"
