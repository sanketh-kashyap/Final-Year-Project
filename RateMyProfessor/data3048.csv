Overall, she was okay. I was disappointed in her lack of an open door policy (which is supposed to be traditional for faculty at Dal Law). But I like how she had Prof. Yogis (emeritus) sub for classes instead of making us do double header make up classes."

I like to be taught by the professor, not my fellow classmates or myself at home. The class is stressful, and her method makes it hard for me to pay attention."
