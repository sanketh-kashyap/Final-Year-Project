Most students were afraid to raise their hands after just a few weeks. Extremely unstructured environment. No fun at all."

She doesn\'t teach in a typical college/military format. She is more of a free spirit teacher. You learn and she is helpful, just if your looking for structured teaching environment she may not be for you. Overall a good teacher, just not for everyone."
