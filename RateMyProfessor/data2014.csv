He can be full of himself but I just think it\'s him being funny. He definitely can make you laugh. I wouldn\'t mind taking another class with this professor."

Yells at students for looking at the clock. Gives tests on chapters that have yet to be completed

He also was super helpful- once before the first exam he held a review session for the class during the weekend. Sometimes lessons could get a little confusing, but the textbook helped clarify. Overall, good professor."

He can and will point out very minor flaws and disregard your overall understanding. Anything but perfection will set him off. Would not recommend this professor, at all..."

He has good reason though since basic economics really hasn\'t changed. He will often quiz off of questions at the end of the chapter in the book. Gets sidetracked with some weird- ass funny stories, but its a good break from class."
