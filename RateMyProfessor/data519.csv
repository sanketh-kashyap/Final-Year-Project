She made all the material applicable and there were a few small assignments throughout the semester but as long as you did them then your grade was raised. I\'d recommend her!

I had no interest in science but she made it interesting and applicable. If you do all the assignments and look over notes before test you\'ll get an A.

I am going into environmental engineering because of her! you can tell she is so passionate about what she talks about and she has a great way of presenting the material. Overall I learned a lot and it really was not much studying.

She also makes an effort to make class interesting by showing videos and using humor in addition to her power points. I had no interest whatsoever in Bio before I had her but she did an excellent job

She\'s unique and opinionated, but wants to open her student\'s eyes to things they may have not been aware of. Relates bio to real world issues. I am NOT a science student, but I went to every class and my lowest test grade was an 86%, minimal studying. Take her, pay attention-you\'ll do well."

If you attend her class review the power points you will do well on exams. She has several assignments are great grade boosters! I would take her more of her classes.

All she does during class is tell stories and push her opinions on you. The only good thing about this class is that it\'s easy other than that it is a waste of time."

The entire class period literally all she does is push her agenda on you. Going to the farmer\'s market has nothing to do with the curriculum and yet it is a 30 point MANDATORY assignment. She is pointless and so is her class. Prepare to be constantly annoyed.
