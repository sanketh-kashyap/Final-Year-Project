She is a bit of a scatter brain and you can get lost during her lecture. A lot of reading but only 4 pages to write. Go to conferences and show up to class and you will pass the class."

She\'s boring if you\'re expecting to do no work to become a better writer. She cares about students and will do whatever she can on her part to help you succeed, making time (hours, unpaid) after class to meet with each student."
