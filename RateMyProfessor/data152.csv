This class does involve you to actually participate and put in some work. If you\'re lazy you probably won\'t enjoy it. You can gain a lot out of this class by putting in that effort. She\'s very clear on the poses and will help you if you need it. Really enjoyed this class"

She\'s sweet and a delight to around.

Ms. Zank is one of my favorites; she gives clear feedback and advice. It\'s an easy ""A"" if you put forth the effort. Dedicate yourself to showing up to class, be punctual; if you miss out, you make up. Don\'t take this class expecting to just laze about, you have to earn your grade! Would take again! 3"

Yoga probably comes naturally to her; she has a harder time explaining how to do a pose or how to adjust it if you\'re having a hard time with it. Regular attendance and you\'ll do fine.
