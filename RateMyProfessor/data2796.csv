He expects you to read the required section before class. Otherwise, you will be lost. He gives a fair feedback. He makes sure you understand the work. I don\'t understand why people give him a low review. He\'s great. Very nice man too."

Although he does expect the student to read the material before class, failing to do so can get you lost in his class. Reading the text before he lectures is a must! But Mr. Rhodes is an enjoyable teacher with a laid back personality and sense of humor!!"
