She is brilliant, insightful, and kind. I have never worked with a professor who cared so deeply about her students, held them to such high yet achievable standards, and was so willing to offer her time to a struggling student. She has my highest possible recommendation. Take her class!"

She gives several assignments that do not count towards your final grade to give you an idea of where you are in the class. She gives good feedback but it is unclear on what she wants when she grades the final project. We\'re shocked by final grades that are low even after following her criteria.

Multiple students were given positive feedback and then blindsided with low grades. After full support over 5 weeks and three meetings on my project, instructor changed her mind and decided she did not like my thesis (that she had approved) and had me restart a semester-long project 3 days before due date."

She\'s tough-minded, and will hold you to high standards (so if you\'re looking for an easy ride, this is not your class), but is absolutely dedicated. You will learn, and remember what you learned."

Take a different professor if you can because doing good work won\'t necessarily get you a passing grade."
