Hands off but not completely disconnected. The only minor annoyance was multiple promises to grade homework early but she never delivered on it. It was a waste of having to buy the SNHU ""textbook bundle"" for this class though. My computer lab book is still in the plastic. (Not the professors fault, but SNHU I think.)"

She wasn\'t a bad teacher and the class was pretty easy. She does take a while to grade things, but it wasn\'t that big of a deal. She always answered my questions promptly and was helpful. All you have to do is participate in the discussions and do your work, and you\'ll get an A."

I went in knowing quite a bit so this class was a breeze for me. Shrug, I don\'t understand how people can not know some of that stuff."

I didn\'t learn too much that was new, but I had a lot of computer experience prior to this course. She\'s very flexible and easy to talk to about things. She doesn\'t keep up with/update grades too regularly though."
