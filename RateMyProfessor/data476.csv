He wants you to be a learned scholar in all facets not just econ. I didn\'t open the book once because he teaches so differently from it. Go to class and listen when he says to form a study group. The homework is hard at first but prepares you very well. Don\'t do anything last minute and you\'ll be fine.

Sometimes I think he\'s too smart for his own good. He is one of the most brilliant professors I\'ve had at UCD. I\'m an Econ minor and love the whole dept. He cares a lot about his students. The only odd parts are his methods of keeping student\'s focus. I highly recommend him, but take at least a low level calc class first."

He actually takes time to explain concepts and makes sure he answers questions. The tests aren\'t terrible as long as you study a little. Sure, he gets off topic quite a bit but it keeps the class entertaining. Highly recommended!"

He is very straight forward about what he expects you to know and helps you to understand what is fundamental. He makes the information easy. I wish I could have him as a math professor for all my math courses.

It is very hard to learn from him because he is constantly going off on tangents. He also spends most of the class talking about different schools, not about economics. I had to teach most of the material to myself and I worked my butt off and had an A all semester and then ended up with an A- Very disappointed"
