Make sure that you put in time on the homework and ask if you have questions about what is needed.

Grades are arbitrary with the requirements usually unknown. Expect to lose a LOT of points for no reason. Nothing well explained, only some of notes posted. Textbook is used once, borrow from someone who did get it"

Doesn\'t seem to have the material mastered...makes lots of mistakes on notes...etc. Never heard a professor say I will have to check the book. He was ok...but the HW assignments were a bit long........"
