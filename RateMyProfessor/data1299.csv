She keeps a regularly boring class, interesting. You do have to go to class to do well, but it\'s worth it. She is understanding and fun, her only downfall is she doesn\'t give 100\'s but I wouldn\'t say her grading is harsh. You just have to work for it."

She\'s HILARIOUS! I look forward to this class becaus she makes it fun and interesting. I would take her again if she taught more classes. I recommend her to everyone looking for a good history class!"

She teaches like a giant story and its really easy to follow along! you need to go to class and take good notes because she wants details on exams but she is so good!

No matter how much you study it is hard to get a satisfactory grade. True she offers extra credit and such, but it does not help. For your sanity please consider taking another professor."

Take good notes because her exams are detailed. She is very specific with what she wants but is very good with her office hours. Her essay assignments aren\'t bad and she will read over your drafts. TAKE HER!"

Her tests are on very specific material that are barely mentioned in class. Her assignments are reasonably challenging, but she grades them like a b#!*h. I am amazing at writing papers and all that, and she never gave me full credit for anything."

It is race and immigration.. She grades harder than any teacher I have had and the class average was a C-. Great teacher :/

I studied all the notes and read the book just as much as any other class. She grades like race and ethnicity is your major. I do not like her at all

She appeals to all learning types by showing clips and is really funny and makes learning fun. She reviews what we learned in the previous class. Make sure to take notes she doesn\'t post it but she makes going to class fun. DO TAKE HER CLASS!
