He expects us to automatically understand everything he is talking about and we have to teach ourselves all of the material. If someone tries to ask him a simple question, he will cut you off and get very red and flustered. Waste of my time and money, I learned nothing whatsoever. Disappointment."

He expects that you already know what hes talking about. He talks a lot about the history of stuff instead of the actual stuff we are learning. He is very excited about chemistry but needs to relize we are trying to learn this crap. If we already knew it then we wouldnt be in the class.

DO NOT try to ask questions during his class he will just cut you off and tell you he doesn\'t have time to answer anything. He does teach like we should already know it all, not helpful for those of us that do really ""Get it"" anyway. I wish I had someone different..."

He\'s been teaching chemistry for 47 years, most of them high school. This info is old hat to him, so he teaches it just as he understands it, not through the eyes of chem virgins. Lets you use notes on quizzes, tests, etc. Gives plenty of hand-outs that can be used on tests and the final too. Just do the work!"

Everything on the weekly quizzes was covered by lecture and your problem sets. He allowed 3x5 note cards for the quiz. He\'s not a nit picky grader, if you at least completely attempted to do everything he gave you full credit."

Most of the time you will never understand what he is talking about. However, his quizs are pretty easy tho and he gives us some extra creadit too."

Also, if you are taking this course as a nursing prerequisite it will be VERY hard to get a good grade, no matter how hard you study. This teacher is very disorganized, and out of touch."

He is nice, however, he doesn\'t cover what he tests us on in class. Isn\'t available during office hours, is an extremely hard grader. He doesn\'t offer any study guides and really doesn\'t clarify what\'s going to be on his tests. He doesn\'t follow through with teaching aids he said he would provide."
