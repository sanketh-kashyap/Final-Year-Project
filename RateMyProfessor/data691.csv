Do ur lab & make sure he check it off & ur ready to go. Make sure u answer all the questions correctly on the lab sheet and homework b/c he counts that for the grade. There was no final exam for him, so he took 11 best labs and that made r final 25% of the grade for this class."

This man acts like he has a problem with his voice which keeps him from speaking louder. I did not do well in his class and I am going to take a different professor the next time around. Do not take his lab course either because from what I have heard, this man is terrible. Just don\'t take him."

If you have all the time to study then you will do fine but if you don\'t then don\'t expect a high grade. He is very easy going when grading."

His class is a huge mistake and the only people that stand a chance of passing this person\'s class is someone who has a well prior knowledge of chemistry. But to be fair, his class gets easier as more students drop the class, what a shame."
