Until Dr. Esperanza, I thought inspiring, motivated, and truly compassionate educators were a myth. She grades fairly. Respects and welcomes all input in class discussions. Focus is less on assigning anxiety-provoking amounts of homework and tests, more on educating and empowering. I am lucky to have met her."

As long as you participate, do the homework, and pay attention, you will do fine. Understands the night class struggle of work and school balance which is appreciated."

IF you have the chance please take her. She is very inspirational and her lectures are very fun. She will give you a book you can buy off Amazon instead of the pricey ones from the book store. I would definitely take another class with her.
