For his tests you literally had to fill in whole quotes from the textbook which was an absolute drag to read. I finally started to get the hang of his tests and he started gypping me points and would only give me a few points that I deserved back even though he would ADMIT that I should have received more

This class is very intense in terms of content because it challenges you towards personal growth. Overall it has been my favorite class to date. I thought it was easy but everyone seemed to think the class was very hard. Tests are T/F, fill in the blank, and discussion. The key is reading the book well and studying"

He was very nice and always wanted his students to succeed. He always told us that he was our teacher but if we ever needed anything outside of class his office was always open! Great christian man!

Such a caring man and I love how he uses stories in each of his classes. I had him for Marriage and the Family and also Foundations of Christian Psychology. Also he is my adviser and I have been in counseling sessions with him. So true and real, not afraid to be blunt."

It was okay. We never used the book in class, yet the tests were always over the book, not class discussions. Also, he and his wife shared some awkward personal details that I could have lived without hearing. If I don\'t want to hear it from my parents, I don\'t want to hear from you either!"
