Beth  Whitish,Southwest Wisconsin Technical College,Education department, Fennimore, WI,0,5.0,N/A,2.0,,1,01/29/2009,HSN1YRS,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Beth is a very nice professor who is willing to help in any way shape and form for her students. She loves power points, that is her only downer. She has a good sense of homor inside and outside of class. Her friendly cubby is always welcome to all for anything at all. She is uncompareable to her partnering professor. They make a decent team."
