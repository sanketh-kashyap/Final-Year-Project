Lectures lead up to information needed for the take home mid-term and Final. Patience is the key to passing this class, for lectures can become sort of boring depending on how active your peer are or aren\'t. Other than that, this class is an easy B. and A accessible."

No homework or in class assignments. Both the midterm and final are very time consuming but if you take your time then you\'ll do fine. Teacher is extremely helpful and makes the lecture interesting! Highly recommend her!

She is knowledeable & only assigns a mid-term & final. Although she only assigns a midterm & final & allows the book for it, they are intense & take time to complete. Do well on both & you\'ll receive an A in the class."
