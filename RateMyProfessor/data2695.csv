I agree with other person above. If not the worst, one of the worst profs I have ever had. It\'s dumbfounding that he is still allowed to teach. Hint: Check the test bank b/c he may offer the SAME exact exam as he did the previous two years. Wow, talk about laziness."

He is definitely one of the worst professors I have had. Take someone who doesn\'t know their subject and then add a rambling, incomprehensible teaching style and that sums him up. HE SHOULD NOT BE TEACHING LAW."
