She doesn\'t emphasize anything, she\'s boring and her tests are ridiculous. The average grade on our second midterm was a D- and she still refused to curve. I wish Rocky were still here."

She seems like a nice person, but her grading style is off the charts. Her meticulous and most anal ways are very annoying. She grades on small details that are absurd and minor (e.g., subtracting 10 pts because you were had one word too many on an essay). Pfft. What a shame."

She is very clear about what she will test on, very patient, and is easy to talk to! She does grade on small details, but if you study, you should have no problem! Spelling counts on her midterms but not her quizzes. She wants you to learn!"

She was very helpful and willing to explain and re-explain concepts. She may be tough, but the class is tough. I got a B+ and probably didn\'t put in as much effort as I should\'ve. She does grade small details, but she explicitly tells you that she is going to grade those certain details. She\'s not an unreasonable grader"

I\'d definitely choose another one if possible."

She may be an extremely smart person, but her grading is off the wall. She is anal retentive about the smallest details. She demands perfection on her assignments and overall work. She is somewhat easy to talk to, but you can tell she is a little stuck up. Oh, she takes points for saying that ""data"" is not plural. wtf"

I think she\'s an overachiever in many ways. had her originally for bio series labs, she was a pain. Now she\'s still a pain. no change at all. If she wants to become a phd, she should learn to ease up a bit. she\'ll deduct you for the most ridiculous reasons. i guess she\'s just very anal about some things. bleh."

Very caring for the students and respected. But she grades on an impossible scale. Her strictness is incredible overeagering. Crucial points are deducted for extremely silly things (like verb usage--this is NOT an english class). She is noted for her ""hard difficulty"" compared to the rest of the TAs. I\'d pick a diff one."

She is very smart and intelligent, yes. But she is also one of the most demanding and strictest ""future"" professors I have ever met. She is so thorough and detailed that she wants you to know every single object and expects you to be perfect in all your assignments. I would avoid if possible."
