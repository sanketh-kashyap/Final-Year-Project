Simmons really cared about his students, unlike Smith who is moral coward cowering beneath Ligouri. Bring Simmons back and fire the rest!"

He doesn\'t talk ebonics, nor does he continually talk about ""black issues."" whoever said that might be a little to sheltered in their nice upperclass/white community to realize what real issues are."

He rants about liberal propaganda all class. Someone needs to tell him Iona is a conservative Republican college, always has been and always will be. Fire this clown."

But even worse is that his speaking is practically Ebonics, we students can\'t understand him, and his grammatical edits on our papers are often incorrect."
