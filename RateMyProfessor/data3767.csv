I did great in other math courses before this class but earned only B\'s for the in class midterms. However, don\'t be discouraged! I tried my best in the common final and after all I\'ve got A+. Although Li said he wouldn\'t curve, he did give a big curve. Li is nice if you approach him for help."

Granted, I would sometimes have difficulty understanding, but he was more than helpful in office hours and by email. I really enjoyed math with this professor and highly recommend him."

And it isn\'t clear what he is saying, thick accent, and doesn\'t slow down even if you ask him to."

Think the only reason people didn\'t like the class was that there was no book to follow. Personally I enjoyed the class =)"

Take Baochi if she teach it."
