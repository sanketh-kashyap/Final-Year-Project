YOU WON\'T PASS.  PARTICIPATION MATTERS,1,0,"Gittelman is awesome but she grades in a funky way. Mean is a B and top 25% get A\'s based on class rank. Offers extra credit but it\'s not really extra credit - you have to do it since it is accounted for in final grade. Ultimately, the way to get an A is to PARTICIPATE and attend all classes. Midterms are tough (LONG), but she is a chill grader."

Attendance and participation is mandatory, but she does a good job of getting everyone out of their shell. There is a good amount of group work, so take the class with friends if you can. Content was very interesting and I would absolutely take a course with her."

Material for business policy is pretty straight forward and she goes over the concepts A LOT so it\'s fairly easy to understand. Grades were based on online quizzes (easy), two group case reports, a midterm, a final, and participation. As long as you pay attention and do the readings you\'ll be fine."

The subject is pretty easy to grasp. Get a good group for the cases you have to do. PARTICIPATE as much as possible and you\'ll do fine. Midterm was open ended- average was a 80+ It was on class topics and cases. Final: new case provided before hand to read and questions will be on the case. you need the book

Participation is basically your grade. Obviously, do your best on the assignments, exams, etc. Material is very easy. She\'s nice and lectures can be interesting sometimes. Easy BB+ nonetheless."

But prof try\'s to make the material a lot harder than it actual is. A lot of annoying quizzes and projects that take too long than their actually worth. Class is like HS. 40% participation grade.
