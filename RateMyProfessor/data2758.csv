She cares deeply about the field of education and her students. She knows literacy incredibly well and shares her experiences freely. Her assignments were SO clear; everything had a rubric. Just make sure you follow her instructions. An amazing fieldwork instructor as well. Make sure you get the textbook.

Her class consists of no tests, 3 reflection papers, 1 5 page paper, a parent guardian letter, and a case study. She explains things well, does not really go over the content of the book (book is very boring), she is very nice, actually came to everyone\'s school to see them in action during fieldwork. Recommend!"

She creates packets for students who were absent, and really puts a lot of preparation time into the class. Her lectures can be boring and repetitive, but there are fun group activities with candy, posters, and markers."

She shows much love and respect to all students. She\'s helpful and listens to any concerns you may have, even regarding another class. No assignments due until the end of the term and she\'s a very easy grader. Class consists of more lecture than discussion which gets a little boring, but she teaches by example and includes fun activities!"

She is very understanding and friendly and easy to talk to. It is important to participate and offer opinions in class discussions. A lot of work seems to build up at the end of the semester, so it is important to pace yourself. Take this prof if you can!"
