No one is more enthusiastic and knowledgeable about their work than he is. I, like many was devastated when he was let go from Umass Lowell. That was a huge mistake on their behalf."

He\'s very into the class, and very into the students. You have to do homework, I nearly failed cause I didn\'t do it, but it\'s nothing hard. Just pay attention in class and you\'ll be gold. Also, DO NOT miss his ""Transformers"" lecture. It\'s the best."

I\'ve taken Theory I-III and Aural Skills III and IV with him. In his opinion the class\'s grades are a reflection of his teaching. He\'s not easy but not ridiculously hard either. He grades all the homework assignments so be sure to come prepared! But he\'s a great professor and an awesome guy. I miss his classes now that I\'m done.
