(1),6,06/17/2015,MB434,3.0,4.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,N/A,B-,SKIP CLASS? YOU WON\'T PASS.  TOUGH GRADER  RESPECTED,0,0,"Theo is a great person. Lectures are not that bad, though can get tedious sometimes. The course design makes sense, yet the materials are very easy to get confused for the example so be aware!! Only negative part is his exams are super difficult. It is very hard to get an A in this class. ALL of his test questions are short answer but quite vague!!"

He seems to deeply care about his students success and is great in office hours. Sometimes he lectures too quietly

Learning from the book is the best option and the book is very easy to understand. Just make sure to memorize that material."

He has an awesome Aussie accent, is meticulous in his descriptions, and is very excited to discuss the subject matter outside of class. The textbook was written by one of our OSU professors and has some useful diagrams."

The course is very interesting if you just read the book, but he gives surprise in class assignments so you have to go to class. The material is not hard, but you will HATE your term if you try to learn anything from him."
