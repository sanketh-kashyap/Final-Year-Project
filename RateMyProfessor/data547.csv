How he gets paid to teach I don\'t know. Do not take this teacher because you can\'t get back into test if your locked out due to internet connection. Also get zeros for your homework for that week because he is too lazy to unlock them.

He is standing high and mighty on his soap box and enjoys recording audio at home while he coughs and makes weird noises. He has zero interaction with his students and could care less about helping them.
