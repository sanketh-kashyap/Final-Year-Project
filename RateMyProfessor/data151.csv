Prof. Jernigan teaches applicable skills using a hands-on approach. He wants students to understand the value of being resourceful, so he uses a discussion board to allow them to help each other and awards extra-credit for participation. He actively participates as well and is accessible via email and text messaging. Highly recommend!"

Shares lot\'s of real life example. Can text him anytime, and he\'ll reply in less than 30 minutes. Always there for you. Lots of homework, but he guides you through them step by step in a video simulation. Will tell you what to expect on the test. It is a hard class overall so put in a lot of effort. Offers extra credit."

The professor is ok, but there is no book assigned, and the PP aren\'t that great for the type of tests/qzs he has. He puts the assignment solution online so there is no point to learn. I was hopping to learn more SQl, and Tech stuff but i wasted my time. Why all professors care about quantities not qualities."
