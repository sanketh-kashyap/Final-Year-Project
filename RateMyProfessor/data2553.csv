When he does not have an answer he offers his perspective to get you thinking although he is extremely knowledgeable."

Prof. Heim is EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGABLE! HE KNOWS AT LEAST 7 LANGUAGES! HE CERTAINLY HELPED ME WITH MY WRITINGS AND WANTED ME TO SUCCEED! Though I got a B in the class(because EVERYTHING is essay, writings, including midterms&finals in which required 3 essays and 10 3-4 sentence ids), I feel that I LEARNED SO MUCH! So Heim is BEST"
