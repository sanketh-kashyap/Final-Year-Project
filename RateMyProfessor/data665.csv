His teaching style is wonderful and he gives real life examples. His grading is way chill, you could draw a picture on the test and he\'ll give you points for trying. He gives the short answer questions a week in advance for tests. The group project is a joke and an easy A. Try your best to get him for Principles of Marketing."
