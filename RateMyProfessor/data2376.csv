Emeka  Nwaeze,University of Texas at San Antonio,Accounting department, San Antonio, TX,9,3.0,N/A,2.7,GRADED BY FEW THINGS (2)  ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS (1)  Respected (1)  Participation matters (1)  Gives good feedback (1),7,01/14/2018,ACC6013,4.0,3.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,Yes,A,RESPECTED  ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS  GRADED BY FEW THINGS,0,0,"Very interesting class. It was the first time he\'d taught it, so he was very lenient with everything and curved all of the exams. He\'s an excellent lecturer and has a very good sense of humor. I thoroughly enjoyed his class. The exams were a bit nerve-wracking though because we weren\'t sure what we would be tested on. Book wasn\'t really needed."

Much of the class work was not covered in the tests. Same goes for the practice tests. The projects were pretty easy and graded pretty loosely. Presentation matters so make it look good. Overall, I didn\'t learn much in the class and was frequently frustrated by the lectures. Made easy A."

The textbook is nearly unnecessary; save yourself the $$. Emeka is down-to-earth and helpful. Wish he tought some MS classes in the program where the instruction wasn\'t nearly as clear.

However, he does not teach you how to do the calculations needed to complete the homework or the test. He has changed his style in the last couple of years, based on knowing someone who took him for this same class and the class is 100% different from what they had (better when they had him).Many members of class are frustratrated"

Seriously, I thought about taking up a hobby during class. He seems like nice enough guy. He doesn\'t really give partial credit on tests. If you make detail mistakes like I do then his grading is hard, but the tests really aren\'t too bad. Overall, not terrible but definitely not great."

But professor Nwaeze is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. Excellent use of examples and style of teaching that made everything understandable and relevant to real world. I learned alot from this class and will being applying it. His exams are very similar to exercises which he provides solutions."

Often ended class early. No practice exams provided (frustrating) Does note the types of problems that will be on exams throughout classes, but 1st two exams had a random question thrown in. Good easy class if you don\'t need to know this material in depth."
