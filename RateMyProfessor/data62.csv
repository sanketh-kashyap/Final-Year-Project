His class was straightforward; attend class and review your notes and you\'ll ace the exams. There were bland parts to his lectures but the majority is interesting. Exams during lab and one paper graded leniently.

He goes through the lecture pretty quickly too, and chem is a lot to take in. Regardless, he is a great professor who is very knowledgable and helpful one-on-one. He knows his info thats for sure. Would recommend but maybe not early in the morning"

It will definitely help you. BUY his class notes because everything you need to know for the midterm/final and quizzes are in his notes. I got a whopping A+ for simply studying. If I can, you can."

Professor Chichester has never given a single pop quiz in class. If you need extra help on getting concepts explained more clearly after each lecture, he is more than happy to explain to you the concepts if you still don\'t understand them during the lectures."

He is so confusing because he goes trough the notes super fast and at times he is all over the place and his examples are all over the place. I got an A in the class because I read the book but his lectures are all over the place.

Each and every one of them. I\'m not a Chem person, but with studying, I pulled a B+. An A is possible because I was 2% away from it. Study for him. He\'s good at explaining things. He\'s nice and approachable. Take him."

Science has always been my strong suit, but not with his class. He goes through the notes waaay too fast that you can\'t even write notes of your own about it. I don\'t recommend his lecture...unless you\'re a book worm...because reading your textbook is your only chance to pass..."

You don\'t need it, he goes over enough. Pair him with a really good lab instructor (Sherman Lee). Quizzes are kinda hard but pretty irrelevant, midterm and final are easyyy."

Found chem30b way easier. You can buy his class notes from chemistry department, and as long as you show up to lectures and write down a few extra notes, you\'re set to get an A. Also gives out bonus quizzes towards middle and end of semester."

Very helpful. Pay attention in lectures because there\'s extra info to write down in class notes and he tells you which part of notes are important/on quiz. Very approachable, nice. Gives bonus quizzes!"

Be on top of your studies if you want to pass this class. You can easily fall behind in this class since he covers a chapter each week. The things he covers within the slides are guaranteed to be on the quizzes. The book is also helpful for studying, but his class notes are very helpful."

Since he\'s teaching hundreds of students at once he won\'t teach slowly just for you. Be prepared to do lots of studying on your own.

Attending lecture is a must because it is basically stuff you will see on the quizzes, midterm, and finals. Try to keep up with him. He moves from one topic to another very quickly."

He is a great professor that explains everything in detail for you. He gives you extra credit so don\'t worry if you didnt do too well on the weekly quizzes. He talks at a good pace. The book really helps by explaining the material that you were confused about during the lectures. Do the practice quizzes.

He wasn\'t clear, as in things that were on the test werent things he covered in class. He was on ok guy, but if avoidable take another person."

Attend lectures b/c towards the end of the semester he gives EC to those who show up. A really nice guy and a really easy class if you read the book based on his reading schedule. Got an A with effort."
