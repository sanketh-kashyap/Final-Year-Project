YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,Derigan thinks he\'s a law professor with a law degree teaching law classes to law students. None of those things are true. But he can keep living in fantasy land in that old dumpy building on the south end of campus.

He will work with you however, make sure you do the reading and COME TO CLASS and he will be understanding. At least he makes you laugh at least once each class."

I\'m glad one of my first professors was him."

I have never been more impressed and proud of myself looking back at all the information I learned- and it is because he pushed me and believed that I could do it. So pissed I waited until my senior year to take a class from him.

He pushes you to your limits. He expects the best. I have never seen a professor capture a class like he does. This course is scary hard. Makes you work really hard, but it\'s good. You actually learn so much it\'s cool. Come into this class like it is your first job. Derigan notices if you work hard."

He knows media law like the back of his hand and will make you feel the same way each and every day you walk out of class. When he returns exams however, prepare to get your butt handed to you.
