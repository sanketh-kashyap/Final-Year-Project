She is very demanding of her students. However, she is also fair. She expects things to be completed on time and if they are not there are consequences. Lots of experience and willing to share her knowledge. Your blessed if you get her for clinical as you will be better prepped for the next level."

Keep on top of it the best you can because there is a pop quiz almost every class. Ms. Geeze is willing to help with whatever you need, just talk to her.

Exams are tough and there are many of them, she gives pop quizzes either at the beginning or end of class on readings. A passing grade is earned not given in this class, it is tough and overwhelming."

Although very experienced and knowledgeable, this instructor has an overall negative demeanor, sets unclear expectations, and grades really tough. Read, and ask tons of questions about assignments before turning them in."

She is always great about pointing out things to focus on for exams. My only complaint: from time to time she gets off topic or hung up on 1 concept. Overall a very good instructor though."

This program wasted many years of my life and I refused to let them take anymore time from me. I think they need to get rid of most of the nursing staff at CNM and start over!

The class in general was unorganized. Did I mention that Mrs. Geeze is the only lecture instructor for Nurs 1080 so you have no choice but to deal with her aggressive behavior. She tends to ride her students like a bull! Good luck taking her. There is a reason she is not well liked:)

She is a unapproachable rude teacher. If you ask a question she acts like you are bothering her! During a exam review she couldn\'t even give the correct answer but yet the students are suppose to know the material crystal clear.
