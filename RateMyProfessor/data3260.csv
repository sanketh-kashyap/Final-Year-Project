He\'s not there to trick you or anything. It\'s very important you do the readings in order to do well in the tests.

He will give you 100% on every essay question if you demonstrate a sincere effort to understand the material and don\'t make any glaring errors. The Aristotle readings were super difficult, but he explains them in a way that\'s easy to understand. The commentaries were fun and easy to write."

I got 100% in the course & I\'m not a philosophy major. Show up to class and take notes. Bad things: His lectures were long and he didn\'t do much to inspire discussions in the class. Kind of hard to pay attention to."

He tells you the readings which are important for the exams. Make sure you know the authors and at least one point to touch on from each author. If you show you know the material, you will get an A. Really enjoyed the way the exams were set up: 10% quiz, two 40% midterms, final was only 10%."

The class is driven by the readings so if you do the readings and throughly understand them you will be golden for the exams. Exams are fair and straight forward. Get ready to do some heavy reading though and keep up! Make sure to attend class if you can\'t really keep up with the readings as he goes over the main points.

The readings he chose were very interesting. He also has tons of great examples and scenarios to make the topics interesting and he\'s always challenging your way of thinking, which makes you really question your stance on a variety of topics, but in a good way! Would take again!"

Excellent course to take if you have med school on the horizon as the class is very similar to the ethics classes I have in the U of C MD program. Essays are very easy to write since they focus on a scenario and ask you to explore it and state what you would do-- a lot like the MMI

In a neuroethics/legal philosophy course, he provided ample, well-selected resources and direction to ease us into the materials. I was given helpful feedback and offered fair grading on a stringent scale (A = 94%)."

The course was very interesting and helpful for pre-meds, and he is a very reasonable marker-- it\'s entirely possible to get the 94% required for an A in the course. Two papers and two quizzes. The papers are very situation based-- sort of like the MMI-- which makes it interesting to write about."

I thought he was very clear and concise and was always willing to listen to students\' comments and to answer questions.

He is an awkward man who is probably a genius but has no communication skills. His bias shines through when he marks papers - and he takes attendance so you have no option but to go and be bored to death. AVOID.

Extremely boring, stands at front of class and reads from his little pad and pretty much restates the readings and that\'s it. If u do the readings u don\'t need to go to class EXCEPT he takes attendance which is super lame. Very ambiguous on expectations for essays.On top of that, his grading scheme sucks! 80%=B-! Take another prof!"
