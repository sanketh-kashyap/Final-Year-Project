Tests are hard and you never know exactly what she wants you to study. Her assignments are tedious and it\'s obvious she could care less if you pass or fail. This is a 3000 level course, not 4000 like try a little harder to act like you care about the success of your students."

Never want to admit she made a mistake grading your assigments and exams. Overall, she is not willing to help you out. I feel like she enjoys seein you struggle"

Her tests are crazy hard, and you really need to study. Labs are very simple. Class is boring and you def need coffee to keep you awake!!"
