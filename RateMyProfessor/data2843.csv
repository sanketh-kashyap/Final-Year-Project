Checks up on students beginning of every class, patient, and able to answer questions clearly and respectfully. She was able to take very complex concepts and break them down into manageable and easy-to-understand pieces. Syllabus well-organized and truly cares for her students. Exam was tough (long FP), so manage your time well!"

Good class but creating awareness of privilege in a place that perpetuates privilege is a whole other story, can\'t fix that entirely. Putting a ""positive"" twist on that is counterproductive to the cause. Learned that I\'ll never study racism again in law school."

Online readings were consistently not available & students were blamed for not informing her earlier when discovered the day of class. Witty and sarcastic lectures.
