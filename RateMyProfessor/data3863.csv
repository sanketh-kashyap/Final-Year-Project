He also likes to teach using information from his slides instead of the book required for the course.Just touches on each topic not going in depth about ANYTHING. would rather have you bang your head on the wall then take the time to explain something to you"

Goes over material very quickly. Seems like he\'s fairly jaded with computer networking and is just working out the back end of his career to rake in some cash teaching, even warns people not to get into networking at times."

Tony is a very knowledgeable instructor..perhaps too smart. He has a hard time connecting with the less informed student. Take him for the credit but not to better yourself in the subject."
