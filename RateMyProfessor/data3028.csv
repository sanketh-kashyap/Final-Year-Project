I have her now (spring 09) for Special Topics in Juvenile Justice. She provides powerpoint slides after lecture and exam is multiple choice. You have to do a presentation on a case and do 2 page paper. Professor Marano is easy to approach. I highly recommend her and any course she teaches.

So all you have to do is read the text and it is an easy A!!! Don\'t get me wrong her class is interesting and she is such a sweet lady even though..their is never a dumb ques. in her class.
