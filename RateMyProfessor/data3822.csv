Took as 1st semester freshmen. Decided to stick with the class and ended up being the right choice. Gives random extra credit on things like attendance etc. Hard to understand at first but you get used to it. Love his terrible sense of humor. Read the book a lot and LOTS of quizzes which are hard. Worth taking.

You can barely understand him, he rambles off things that don\'t even pertain to the class, and he told us a day in advance that we had two projects due and a big exam on three chapters."

He gives you extra points on tests and quizzes even if you get the answer completely wrong."

All test/quizzes are online. He doesn\'t know how to spell, so you get an answer wrong cause HE can\'t spell correctly. He says his tests are ""grade busters"" but everyone fails. He does NOT teach.

He has quizzes almost every other day and there are about 30 random questions from all over the chapter. Not only main points. Since all test are on the computer, it grades you pretty harshly. Helpful at library though but overall unless you can memorize good luck."

I have a 82 avg and he has a test every week on a new chapter. All you do is read that chapter and you should do fine. I also think he crueves everyones grade at the end of the semester d is in the lib every day for help.

Teacher relies solely on automated quizes/ tests on which he gives you no breaks for minimally wrong answers. If you have a concern about your grade, he is impossible to talk to.

I can\'t even explain enough how hard he is to communicate to in and outside the class. Even getting help from him twice a week does not help understand or do well in his class. I can not believe he has a job.
