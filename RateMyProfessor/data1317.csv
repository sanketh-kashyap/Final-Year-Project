It has been an absolute pleasure to be taught by her. She has young spirit and creates a very welcoming and nourishing environment for future Engineers. She is very willingly to help her students to optimize their engineering projects assigned throughout the semester. She is a MUST have for Engr 10!!!

She was approachable and was always willing to help with any problems you had on projects, or if you needed clarification. Many of these bad reviews are probably from lazy freshmen. If you listen in lectures and read your material the course is straightforward. Just pay attention in class. Would take her again."

I felt unprepared for the first midterm. She essentially said, study the book (which was about 300 pages). She finally did a ""review"" on Mon with the midterm was Wed. After class I asked her to post the notes prior to class, to be able to write them down (they\'re that long!). She said ""I have a life"""
