Steven  Stelzer,ITT Technical Institute: Mount Prospect,Mathematics department, Mount Prospect, IL,0,5.0,N/A,1.0,,1,02/01/2009,PROBSOLV,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Mr. Stelzer taught problem solving my first semester at ITT. (Winter-07) Although math was hard he basically graded us on participation. I hate math but I got an A in his class. He normally stopped class an hour early for ""independent study time"". ITT won\'t let the teachers let you leave early but you get to choose where you study! ;) GOOD TEACHER!"
