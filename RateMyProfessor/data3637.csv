Winston  Roberts,Florida State University,Physics department, Tallahassee, FL,8,3.9,N/A,4.4,Clear grading criteria (1),8,02/24/2017,PHY2049,5.0,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,Yes,A,CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA,0,0,"He was my recitation prof. for physics 2, and I think he did a good job. Great at answering all questions in a way that helped me understand the material. He wants you to do well and is willing to help you and explain what you don\'t understand."

The textbook is his classroom notes, nothing more. He is not very encouraging at all towards a student that is struggling. Professors should realize the opportunity they have to teach and help students learn and grow instead of creating a hostile environment."

You\'ll get carpal tunnel taking 9 pages of notes per class that you won\'t understand. He is not very personable, helpful, and will attack your intelligence if you ask for help. Weekly homework takes an 8 hour day to complete. Plan to spend about 15 hours a week to get very low F\'s on your assignments."

I feel as though I\'ve actually accomplished something, having taken the class and passed. It\'s very difficult and very basic to what physics really is. Perfect weed-out course."

It is very much a weed-out course if there ever was one and unless you\'re already very intelligent, don\'t expect to get an A because the exams are brutal. Overall a great professor I recommend him"

The class is hard though and roberts covers the information very well just a little fast sometimes. You will spend hrs (no joke) on the homework, go to the tutorials and ask legitimate questions or he might laugh at you! haha He tries to act like he\'s mean but he\'s not!"
