No professor like him! enjoyed him a lot, miss being in his class. Took him for three classes. Armando cares how the students can speak the language and encourages practice outside of class. He has a lot of entertaining stories with his lessons and cares for each of his students. He is the first span. teacher to make me want to learn"

He kept moving the Due Dates back on everything done online if anyone said they ""couldn\'t log in"" or any excuse like that though. He\'s a good teacher and you learn a lot, but he\'s sort of a push over and it would be very hard to fail his class. He has a nice accent though, so he\'s fun to listen to and look at!"

Really enjoyed this class. Very helpful and thorough with concepts. Also very accessible for help/questions outside of class. Very funny too, which definitely made a 4 hour summer class worth going to. Would take another class!"

He is hilarious, which really helped being in a 4 hour class this summer. If I ever needed to take another Spanish class I would make sure he was the instructor. He is very fair and clear."

He\'s not that helpful when you ask questions and we didn\'t even touch the textbook; as long as you get the online work done, you\'ll pass. He likes to joke around during class and tell stories about his life in Cuba. He\'s a nice enough guy, but not that good at teaching."

He understand how difficult it is especially with some people having over a year since their last Spanish course. He is very helpful and although sometimes had trouble figuring out how to say what he wanted to say overall his class is definitely worth taking.
