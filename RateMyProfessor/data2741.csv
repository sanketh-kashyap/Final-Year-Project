Teacher was very helpful if needed help. Hardly ever used textbook. Each exam had so much extra credit, and only 1 paper throughout the course. Overall VERY VERY easy!"

The tests are poorly worded. One problem: she seems uncomfortable with the material like she doesn\'t know it well enough to teach the course. She seems intimidated by the class and I feel sorry for her. Don\'t be so hard on her.

Shows us almost irrelevant videos and doesn\'t understand questions asked. Very vague with concepts - students have to explain to other students about the material. Has an annoying and nervous habit... do switch out if you get her.

She would say one thing in lecture but have something completely different in the powerpoint, then never clarify which was correct. Her tests were very vague and could have had multiple correct answers, leading to even more confusion."

Test questions were badly worded and over the most specific details we might not have even discussed. Lectures EXTREMELY boring. Not to mention the fact that she is kind of annoying.

Just go to lecture, take notes, skim the textbook and you\'ll be fine. Isn\'t the best a explaining things or understanding questions. Usually get a few extra points on tests because of a poorly worded question. Super easy paper, not a bad class if you don\'t care about actually learning psych."

Could not give any basis for diagnostics. Not even able to come up with valid reasoning for her professional opinion. Maybe the class should be teaching her

The topic borders on pseudoscience/pop psychology. The data in the textbook has clear biases and many faults in methods of attaining the data. She doesn\'t seem to understand any questions we ask and gets preoccupied with her opinions, without ever answering the questions, even objectively. Overall: UGH."

On numerous occaions she refused to answer questions that our class asked and would ignore certain people\'s raised hands. I would tell anyone that I know to take another professor due to incompetence and ignorance."

Also she\'s a really bad test writer, especially true/false questions, our class always managed to get sever questions thrown out because almost no one in the class got them right because we didn\'t understand them."

She is very quiet, so try to sit in front. 3 tests, no final and a 2 page (easy) research paper. Atten is mandatory and worth a 100 point, easy grade boosts. All notes are posted on carmen and test are straing from the notes, I hardly looked at the book. Exams are MC, TF and some easy fill in the blaks. Lots of ex cred."

She is the most nervous person I have ever come into contact with. Tests are so-so and come from the book and lectures. Lectures are mandatory and count for participation points."
