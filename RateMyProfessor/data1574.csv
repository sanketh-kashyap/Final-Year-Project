I took advertising with her and she is like a preschool teacher in the way she is with her students. There is a lot of little homework assignments in this class but they are all very easy. If you ask her for extra time on something or to submit it late she will let you.

I had an A untill she decided to fail me on the final paper for ""not doing a manditory part of the assignment."" This ""manditory step"" was going to the writting center to have it edited."
