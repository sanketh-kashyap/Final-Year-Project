She had many different teaching strategies. She would lecture, do group activities, bring candy. She even suggested the whole class wear pj\'s to class one night. She would teach until 9, but time would fly."

She is alive and full of energy. There was never a dull moment in this course. I anxiously looked forward to every class. She gave CBT a new meaning.Our last class was held after all papers and tests were completed and although attendance was not required, over 2/3 of the students came which was a true tribute to Angela!"

Kept a night class entertaining, maintained attention. Only class so far where students have really gotten a good opportunity to process experiences in field/job. Although she acts kinda goofy she takes this work very seriously and that shows too. Recommend!"

She is very relaxed in class and keeps it as interesting as possible. Grades fairly and in a reasonable amount of time. I highly recommend her if you\'re not easily offended!

Unreasonable and inflexible. This professor needs to hone her social skills and learn some compassion. Who else docks someone points for absences related to the death of a close family member??? Can\'t recommend this professor."

She uses humor and personal experience to drive points home. Fair but tough with grades. Has class favorites."
