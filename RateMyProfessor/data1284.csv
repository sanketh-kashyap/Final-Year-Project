Bases much of her grading by the grammar in your paper instead of the actual speaking and presenting."

Learned a ton from her, but don\'t take her class if you want an Easy A. She\'s super strict and grades hard, and in my opinion, she belongs in some ivy-league university and far away from the students at gateway.Overall Great professor"

Was a good teacher very precise and grades hard. But I learned a heck of a lot in this class and felt that her ability to teach is top notch. As long as you come to class and do the work that is expected you will do ok. She spells it all out for you and even gives detailed outlines to follow. DONT MISS CLASS!

She is VERY smart & brings out the best in her students. She is willing to help you any time with anything you have a question on. She has to be the best English teacher Gateway has on staff ( and I have now had of them )
