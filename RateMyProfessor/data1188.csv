However, she has zero tolerance for laziness or slacking off. But if you genuinely need her help, she will do everything she can for you. Show up, pay attention, study, and put in the effort she expects, and you\'ll do fine in her class."

She can be really mean at times, but it\'s usually only when you don\'t do what she says. Spanish is really not that hard but she does absolutely nothing to help. She spends so much time talking about her life (as if anyone cares) that we barely learn anything in class. But it\'s not hard to pass."

She talks about things other than Spanish for not just 10 minutes but for 45. She yelled at me for going to the bathroom which is ridiculous. I am an adult and should be able to go to the bathroom when I want too. It is a 2 1/2 hour class for gods sake! I can\'t believe this teacher is still allowed to teach ANYWHERE!

This is not an easy course so be ready to study.

She is completely useless and gets mad when you get up and go to bathroom. She has a major attitude and you can barely understand her. Instead of attempting to teach us spanish she needs to finish learning English.
