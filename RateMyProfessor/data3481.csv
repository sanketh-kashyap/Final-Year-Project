I went into econ bc of him & quit l8r bc the others were creeps or just didn\'t care. I miss going to visit the Grizzly in his den. AU shame on you"

He is very good at relating the material to everyday use. MAKE SURE AND USE HIS OFFICE HOURS IT WILL PAY OFF. Highly recommend him!

It used to be that it was no problem to get an Ag Biz degree, but not anymore. His class is a hassle, everything is on us once we leave the class, and it is really hard. Maybe Stearn or whoever will consider putting in somebody who\'s a little more realistic."

You learn alot about economic concepts and policies. I got an A. Essay tests so you better know your stuff. don\'t take it if your looking for an ""easy"" A, i felt bad for some of my classmates lol"

I think he likes AU, I don\'t think he likes laziness or corruption, which makes him and students suffer- IMHO. I failed the first exam and I had to go to his office about once every two weeks for help and he got me caught up. Same thing happened in my Biz Calc. I failed it, made a B in this one. A+ professor."

If all you want is to fill a credit, DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. If you want to learn economics and be challenged- take this man. If you aren\'t willing to study 5-10 hours a week and go to class every day, this is not your class"

The material he covers is very relevant to every day life. The tests are not easy and your grade will reflect your understanding of the material. If you go to office hours, he is very helpful, and you won\'t have a problem getting an A with a little effort."

I wasn\'t getting it, and I started staying after class and going to office hours and that helped immensely. I\'ve seen him tell people they\'re wrong, but not make fun of them. It\'s the same thing he expects in office hours- think before you speak. And I\'d rather have someone who cares..."

He takes the material and himself waayy to seriously. He wants it to be known that he knows a lot more about economics than you and will even make fun of you if you speak up in class and are wrong. I have him right now and it has been an overall bad experience so far.

Dr. Elliott tries to relate his lectures and material to real world events, and he also gets you to think about government and politics as well. I figured this was going to be stocks and bonds and interest rates, and it wasn\'t. At all. I wish he taught more classes."

Actually cares about his students and is very willing to work with you and help you if you\'re willing to put in the time for his class. Tests are pretty hard, but he\'s very helpful and nice if you go to office hours. He can seem intimidating at times, but he really just cares about his students!"

His exams are really difficult & his final was weighed at 50%, but it was manageable if you did what he said. He said to make a C or above show up to class every day, use office hours a minimum of one hour per week, & study three hours out side of class per week. I did & made an A"

He\'s been willing to meet with me more in appointments than all my other professors at Auburn in 3 years combined. He likes HD\'s, old cars, but he seems to be pretty smart despite that. He\'s pretty conservative, but I can\'t get a read if he\'s Dem or Rep."

He runs the gamut from manic to restrained, and from utterly boring to fascinating. He is also intimidating(his personality) and he moves at a whirlwhind pace. It\'s hard to dislike him, but his tests and class are hard, and we\'re here for fun not some class in econ."
