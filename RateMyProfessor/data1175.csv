He wears the same shoes from walmart with the velcroe straps and shaved once all quarter. He doesnt drop any test grades and h/w is given every 3 days and due in 3. He assigned a online test and final on the same day.So 2 test in 1 day plus 4 H/W assingments.Terrible teacher and I would never suggest him!!!
