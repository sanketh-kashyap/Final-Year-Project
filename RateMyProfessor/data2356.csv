Melissa  Micou,University of California San Diego,Engineering department, La Jolla, CA,3,3.7,N/A,3.3,,10,04/03/2012,BENG166A,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Dr. Micou is a great professor, one that actually cares about student education. I\'ve taken her for a number of classes and have always found her lectures to be engaging; she does a great job of educating students on all aspects of a subject matter. Her exams are challenging, but fair. I would recommend her to future BE students."

She is one of the few bioengineering teachers at UCSD who actually care about students learning. She does everything in her power to convey the material clearly. Her tests are representative of the course material. Very helpful and friendly in office hours as well. Excellent professor overall.

All of the of the labs were engaging and fun! I learned a lot about tissue engineering, analyzing large data sets, making real-world engineering calculations, and performing rigorous statistical calculations. Dr. Micou is certainly one of the best professors in the bioengineering dept!"

She stressed understanding and application of the material, which is what engineering is, over memorization and detail"

She\'s really straight forward,stats just uses a lot of double negative terms. If a subject is covered more heavily in class, it\'s covered more heavily on the midterm and final. She stresses comprehension of material, so the final and midterm are really conceptual.READ THE BOOK. She let us ask q\'s on the final"

Uses the word ""and"" 3 times on t/f questions. Her curve makes no since. Quizzes are easy and irrelevant because everyone aces them. The midterm and final are horrible. I hate her. Gives mostly B\'s. Too bad you HAVE to take her."

She never works problems out on the board correctly and make simple things very complex. She would spend a long time on the very easy stuff and gloss over the though material but expect us to know it. She does not have a good understanding of the material herself."

Not about the material, but about random things that don\'t matter. Several times per class, she starts talking about things that are completely irrelevant to the topic. During lecture on statistical power, she talked for 25 minutes about a software package that she didn\'t like. ALWAYS has mistakes in quizzes and lecture."

I also dont like how she doesn\'t allow questions during the final because if I had clearly understood the diagram, which should be a given, I would have gotten the problem right.. But she is a good prof. and gives decent and doable questions on the exams"
