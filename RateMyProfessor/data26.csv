She has rules about tardiness, so don\'t plan on coming late to class. Very professional, organized, and grades assignments quickly. I learned a lot in her class, and would highly recommend her."

Her lectures can get a little dry sometimes, but I think that was mostly due to me taking a 3 hour night class, once a week. I could see how some people would rate her as ""not easy"", because she expects you to be accountable for your actions. I see that as responsibility, some see it as being mean."
