Makes lecture actually interesting and his sense of humor is on point. He has a monotone voice, but that makes his delivery of sarcastic jokes so much better so you don\'t really get tired or bored of it. Don\'t skip class, come in late, or have your phone go off."

He sounds just like Ray Romano, though, so be ready."

He has a monotone type voice, which can be annoying, but he tries to crack jokes every now and then to lighten the mood. Very nice guy. If you\'re taking Finite I recommend Kirk."

He\'s a nice guy but the course is confusing if math is not your strong suit going into it. Going to office hours/Teter help is always a good idea!"

He also can be very understanding with students. If you have to take finite take him!

He does a great job making sure that his students know only what they need for the test. Other teachers do ridiculous amounts of webwork problems, but Kirk only does what is necessary to learn the material."

Only thing he hates is people who walk in late and cell phones. He\'s also only so-so in office hours, but he makes himself very approachable so asking questions in class is no big deal."
