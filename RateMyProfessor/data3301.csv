One thing to consider though is it\'ll be hard to concentrate listening to him teaching because he\'s so goodlooking/charismatic that you just want to stare at him the whole time.

He means well, but is smug about his finance and teaches at a level WAY higher than what he should. Material covered in class vs. material on tests and exams aren\'t even comparable. Stay away."

He was actually helpful and if you email him he is willing to clarify the context. However, you do need to put hard work into his class, and go to all classes and make notes b/c he tests from his lectures at times! Hard work= reap the rewards! and he might look arrogant but he is very down to earth if u chat with him"

Expects you to teach yourself, and isn\'t helpful in office hours. I once emailed him for help and he told me to ""read the question again"" instead of explaining what I was confused about IN the question. Lecture sucks, textbook is no help, you basically have to teach yourself w/ past midterms and exams."

Slides are too long. Tutorials are useless. Makes poor use of resources - expects you to teach yourself problems using past papers. Not sure why he feels compelled to teach one thing and test another. Questions are TOO HARD considering the examples taught!

The midterm was similar to the first assignment. The exam was harder because the questions had a twist-so you need to pay attention to the wording of the questions. Overall it was a good course. Huggins is a good instructor, he makes the material interesting."

Only give 5 min. break cuz so many topics to cover. Barely takes a breather...he pretty much goes on the fast lane when lecturing. But interesting lecture overall and tips that he gives us from time to time.
