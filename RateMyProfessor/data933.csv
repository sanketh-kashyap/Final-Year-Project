He\'s my advisor so i\'m kinda biased but he really cares about his students and loves the Spanish Language. He has lots of knowledge with his age and it really shows. He is kinda scatterbrained but if you participate and try you will pass. I\'m glad he was my prof since this is a 5000 class and required for my major!

It is a medieval literature class- I needed it for credit. Dr. Felkel really cares about each of his students and wanted us all to do well! I would recommend him for any Spanish class, and if you\'re interested in advanced literature, then this class for sure!"

His class is definitely hard and takes up a LOT of your time, but I have learned so much in the class. He genuinely cares about students and wants them to do well. He does expect you to read and do the work, and DO IT because it really helps! He is very fair and you can tell he is passionate about teaching."

He is really passionate about the subject, but if you don\'t read and prepare well for class it will be easy to fall behind. You can use the older edition of the book for this class to save money."
