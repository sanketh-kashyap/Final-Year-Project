His teaching style is very much ""out of the book,"" so don\'t expect too many classroom activities that truly test whether you understand the material or not."

He puts a lot of time into his lectures and is helpful outside of class. The tests are harder than those that Buttrey gave in thermo 1 but make sure you remember any equation that Epps boxed in class. Epps receives a medium recommendation from me."

But the class overall is not too bad, tests are fairly reasonable for CHEG."

WHEN LECTURES GOT BORING I WOULD JUST STARE AT THAT AMAZING BODY AND THAT CUTE SMILE.
