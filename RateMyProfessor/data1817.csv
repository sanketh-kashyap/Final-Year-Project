His course is only for students who are serious about learning Arabic, and who are willing to attend nearly all of the classes. He\'s very smart and dedicated, and puts even more effort into his classes than his students do. He wants everyone to succeed and has always been available for extra help. Take him!"

Trust me, read the book and go to his office hours. He does not want anyone to fail and will do whatever it takes to pass his students. I love him - please take him :)"

He really cares about his students and the class. I had a hard time learning Arabic, but with his help I was able to get a C where I probably would have failed otherwise."

Im not arab but it was obvious that he didnt like them much. had a friend whom he assumed knew arabic just because they were arab even though they didnt. if he chooses not to like you- leave the class as soon as you know because it will be reflective in your grades

Truly passionate about the progress and development of his students. Lays an unshakably solid groundwork of Arabic which makes independent and advanced study much easier. Cracks me up on the regular. Arabic is no piece of cake but don\'t be intimidated he\'s incredibly patient BUT u MUST go to class

Arabic is a VERY difficult language to learn, and plan on starting from square 1 if you decide to take it. Shukri is, however, the best prof you could try and learn it with. He is helpful and clear, and his resume leaves nothing to be desired. He teaches at UMW and elsewhere, and knows his stuff."

Great for those who want to go into Arabic masters, but pointless for everyone else. Take it at NoVa."

Be sure to never skip class, he wont let you forget it! Everything he writes on the board is important as well as the handouts. Be prepared to speak in class! He really wants his students to learn Arabic and is passionate about it. Sometimes is funny! Tests are pretty straigt forward! Do your work!"
