Weekly discussion board posts & quizzes. No cumulative midterm or final. Textbook is cheap to rent- $25+. He will quickly fix your grade if he happens to make a mistake. Lots of points possible so it\'s ok if you miss a couple tests/posts. Organized & interesting. This is how an online class is supposed to be!! (:

He is so passionate about sociology and he has plenty to talk about including his own experiences and real world examples. I had him for Soc 102 Research methods and I don\'t regret it at all. You have to read a lot and there is a test every week but its not hard if you just read the material.

Lectures are never boring and grading is simple. Test every week on the lecture the week before. Sounds annoying but this strategy works well! Study the study guides thoroughly and read over the chapter for tests. HIGHLY recommend!

Mr. Little is very Down to Earth, young, and knows his stuff. Not hard on the eyes either.;)"
