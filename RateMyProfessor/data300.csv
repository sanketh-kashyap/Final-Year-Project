Shes funny & brings that humor to her lectures. Reading quizzes get you ready for the lecture to come. Tests are straightforward & she gives you a review. Attendance is part of your grade so dont skip class. She makes A&P fun & easy to understand using real world examples. Students love her!

She\'s a very nice lady who loves what she does. Her knowledge on the human body is remarkable. She will answer questions Physical Therapists are clueless about. Your opportunity to get an A is there if you pay attention and do the work. If your a slacker then your grade will reflect it.

For someone who is not particularly academically strong, I was able to receive an A+ in her class. She is very clear on her expectations and provides as much support as you need. I\'d recommend her class to anyone."

She made sure you had all the info you needed and would hint to you what would be on the test. All the quizes were online and had a time limit, but it was still easy to look through your notes for the answers. She was willing to help if you needed it."

We ran the track and worked out in the weight room (which she helps you create a program for). Brenda is very easy-going, but do not screw around, or you will fail."

Even if you hate excercise and you come in and show effort Brenda will give you a good grade! There is little book work labs due every week. Its basically only a small worksheet. TAKE THIS CLASS!

You keep weekly logs of the exercise you do in and out of class, and that\'s it. I enjoyed this class, but do not take it if you are lazy, because you wont be motivated to do anything."

No books or homework. You do need to go to class otherwise you fail."

Class is an activity class. No homework/papers to do. She even starts class 5 mins late so that if you are on the other side of campus you can make it to class. Be prepared though - she usually goes right up until class time ends.

She treated it like a high school gym class instead of teaching us real exercise things. Consistently started the class late and ended too late to make it to next classes. An overall pointless class that I shouldn\'t have wasted my time taking.

Attendance is extremely important though because it\'s an activity course. Fun class. 2 half-credit sections are required to graduate. Take them both with her back to back (8 weeks each)
