She is willing to go out of her way to help you out and she wants to make sure you are learning and getting what you need out of the class. She really tries.

Extremely unclear. Has no idea how to lead class discussions. Doesn\'t stay on track. Very unprepared. Disappointed that I spend so much money to go to school and get stuck with professors like Jodee.

Nice & helpful. brought cookies last day of class. Tests were more applied &less memorizing. A lot of common sense stuff. Students take advantage of her quietness & can be disrespectful when she\'s trying to talk or teach. It\'s not her fault, college students should act like college students & automatically be respectful."

I felt like I was in a middle school class with people having to be reminded about speaking in turn. Also a poor facilitator of discussions.
