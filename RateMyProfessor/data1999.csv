Stewart  Elgie,University of Ottawa,Law department, Ottawa, ON,5,2.5,N/A,3.8,,4,04/23/2016,CML1105I,2.5,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Elgie did his Doctorate and Yale and an LLM at Harvard. Received a Law Society Medal for contributions to Enviro Law. Won all his cases at the SCC. Super smart and very fun to listen to. But... he\'s not good at the practical stuff like clear expectations, help on assignments and his exams are really tough to study for. Nice guy, but beware."

His course is very high level for first year students in terms of course content. In comparison to other thematic courses, Resource Law is definitely one of the more challenging options. Tread carefully."

He significantly lacks direction and support for his main assignments. Many people found the major paper difficult because he was not clear on expectations for the assignment."

Hard but fair marker and he\'ll give you feedback throughout the semester. The only thing is that he assumes a high level of knowledge prior, so it\'s easy to get lost if you\'re taking his class in 1L. Be ready to do extra reading on your own."
