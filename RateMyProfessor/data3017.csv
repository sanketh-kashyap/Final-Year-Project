Grading appears very easy and forgiving. Class takes some time, one small project a week. Professor was very slow getting grades to us and seemed to be completely gone for a week or so when the class server went down. Class was more interesting than I expected though."

All of his lectures were posted online at the beginning of the class, so there was no required course attendance during the week. Homework was assigned weekly and was relevant to the weekly material. He answered questions quickly and was interested in seeing the students succeed."

Professor was very helpful in answering questions and took an active interest in class discussions. Overall a good survey class that covers a broad array of material. No exams. Weekly projects required just the right amount of effort to learn but not feel overwhelmed.

It is an intro course, and the professor has things well organized and covers quite a few topics. Nothing too in depth. No tests, but a project every week that took a moderate amount of time (I\'m new to this). I actually enjoyed the course, and I like the freedom of doing it online."
