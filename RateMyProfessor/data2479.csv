Easy class because you don\'t necessarily have to be amazingly artistic. He leaves you to do your own thing, but helps you with how to do it. class attendance is not mandatory, but you dont want to miss what he goes over. loved his class!!!"

He\'s a bit scatterbrained but it just makes him funny. He gives guidelines and teaches you the basics, then once you\'ve got a handle on it, pretty much leaves you to your own devices. Personally, I really enjoyed this chance to be creative."
