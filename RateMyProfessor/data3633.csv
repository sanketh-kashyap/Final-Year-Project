Going in I was definitely nervous to talk in front of a class but she made the class very enjoyable and made public speaking seem not so scary. I have nothing bad to say about her she is an amazing person and professor!

No quizzes either. There\'s a rhetorical criticism paper you have to write, and there are 4 speeches for the whole semester. Not bad compared to other teachers. I would definitely take her again and I HATE public speaking."

She has a lot of energy and loves what she teaches. She will motivate you to do your best and as long as you prepare for class you will do well. She loves helping students with their speeches so don\'t be afraid to ask her. Just make sure to let her know if you\'re going to miss a class.
