The modules were not informative, the book is rarely used, and the professor is not as helpful as one would wish. I have no idea where half of the information on the quizzes came from. This guy is weird. If you can take this class with another professor, do it!!!"

He is funny with his weekly announcements and is always available to help. He responded to my questions mostly in the same day and grading was quick as lightning. There is no reason you shouldn\'t get an A in this class unless you have some difficulty with grammar, in which he is helpful!"

The beginning was easy but then the workload became heavy. On top of my other classes and out of school responsibilities, I had to take an F for the class because I was unable to complete the assignments on time. I wouldn\'t recommend this class unless you really like vigorous work."

He clearly states in everything he writes if you have any questions just ASK. He is very helpful and I really enjoyed the assignments."

His quiz does not follow either the textbook, syllabus or learning module, instead you have to keep your book close and plan having to read chapters that were not assigned as part of the module to find the answers. HORRIBLE"

Prof. Steinbaugh was entertaining and engaging throughout the course. He replies to questions promptly. I thought he was down to earth and fair. Easy class. Beneficial for the workplace. I wouldn\'t hesitate in taking another class with this professor.

I took the online version of his class so I didn\'t mind much because you can choose what you listen to during an online class. He does take forever to grade, but that could be because grading 4,000 word papers for around 60 students takes time. I didn\'t like him much from my experience."

His answers to students questions were often sarcastic, his grading system is mysterious (you will not know your grade until the end of the semester). Easy class, but not very fun."
