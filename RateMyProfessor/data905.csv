Caron  Chess,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,Environmental Science department, New Brunswick, NJ,1,1.8,N/A,3.5,,2,04/05/2011,EPIB353,1.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Tried taking Public Participation and the course was extremely boring and almost useless. the material is so easy but she just repeats the same stuff every lecture. she says how she\'s an easy grader and doesn\'t expect much detail but then grades the opposite and criticizes if there isn\'t enough detail. not the best professor.
