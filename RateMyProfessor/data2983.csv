If you need her help she\'s there for you and even offers office time. Most of the work is done on computers and she makes it interesting and interactive. She\'s even allows you to call her by her first name. If you failed this class, you might as well rethink what you want to do in life because she\'s an easy A."

She has a wealth of knowledge and is very encouraging. I have taken 2 classes with her, digital and B&W photography, and would take more classes with her if I could. All she asks is that you attend class, and keep up with assignments, and you can get a good grade. Her enthusiasm inspired me to work as hard as possible."

All she asks for is for students to keep up with the assignments. Very much recommended."
