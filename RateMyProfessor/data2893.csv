She challenges you, and you walk away with a lot of information; she communicates well, and is incredibly fair. 6 quizzes and a cumulative final, but gives the class opportunities to work off some information (vocab games to lessen vocab on the test, etc). She\'s why I\'m an Italian minor."

I have taken a range of classes from bio to history to sociology, and nobody compares to how well she can communicate with students. I have been truly inspired by this woman.
