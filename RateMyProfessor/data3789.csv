She is a graduate student who teaches courses so she is young and has a spunky personality. Her tests were reasonably easy because she thoroughly goes in depth during notes and makes the topics very easy to comprehend. The speeches are the hardest part about this class and I did not struggle with them at all. She is a very easy grader.
