He\'s very invested in the material and in helping you understand it. He\'s extremely helpful, funny, and caring. Literally everything that he covers in lecture will be on the exams so I barely used the book. Only 1 group project. Great guy"

He was super helpful in and outside of class. If someone didn\'t understand something, he was more than willing to go back over it. His tests were very fair, but not too difficult. Just study your notes and read the textbook and you will be fine. I wish I could take this class again! Highly recommend!"
