So for the reading, make sure to understand whay you\'re reading and if you don\'t come to class. That discussion you have in class is super important. The tests are 85% on that discussion I guarantee you. Participate, record if you have to. The summaries are IMPORTANT. Do all this and you\'d be fine."

His lectures are rarely on the actual topic of the class, but instead can often be described as ""I\'m better than you, and here\'s why."" To top it off, he doesn\'t even grade the tests or homeworks himself. He paid someone else to do it. There should be rules against this."

His Psychoanalysis class is the worse, the reading is horrible not only its a lot of reading but very hard to follow.

Spent way too much talking about politics and chess. His humor either complimented his lectures or got in the way. He\'s unorganized and prone to going on many tangents.

It is rare to find someone from the psych dept. who isn\'t teaching as a job, but rather as a passion. He loves the subject (all psych, not just evol psych) and will spend time going off on tangents that always somehow come back to the lecture. Not easy to understand his teaching method, but it works eventually"
