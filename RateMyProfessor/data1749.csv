Class is in a discussion format so it is important to participate. I came into the class knowing nothing about the topic and learned a lot. Political class so the stronger opinions you have the more meaningful the discussions are. Recommend this class 100%

He likes to talk about anything that can be applied to the law or precedent being discussed. He is a wonderful, caring, helpful teacher. His class is easy if you pay attention and come to class. We wrote one paper and did some other readings. He\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful man!"

Dr. Epley loves students that work hard, goes out of his way to help you, and stays in touch even after the class is over. Class discussions were always fun & challenging. Entire grade = three papers."

He has so much to offer in terms of real world application. Take his law and finance class. No books - all materials are practical, websites, cases, etc. He serves donuts, cookies, and coffee. He\'s pretty handsome too!"
