David  Evans,University of South Florida,Research department, Tampa, FL,0,2.0,N/A,2.5,,2,03/20/2009,PPE4403,3.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I\'m afraid his only motivation in teaching this class is funding for his research. He had no interest level in the material. None. Class average oddly low, so he curves. All my B+\'s became A\'s, and I never attended class, nor read more of the book than the chapter summaries. If you can retain PP info, take notes at home and don\'t bother coming."

He is very boring and monotone.His lecture slides only cover maybe 25%of text info &you are tested on everything you read down to specific correlation coefficients from studies in text.He offers up to 70extra credit points,which should say a lot about his test"
