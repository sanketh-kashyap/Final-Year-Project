The only problem is that he is very very boring. During lecture he read directly from the PowerPoint slides as well as for homework problems, didn\'t take full advantage of Wiley+. Doing HW is the key to pass. If you\'re a visual learner he is not the one for you."

Very few examples or real life analogies to help you understand the material. Do yourself a favor and watch the course on youtube videos from JCCC - (D. Krug is amazing!) that\'s the only way I survived. I would avoid if possible!"

He is a great teacher for a very hard subject. You have to work in this class since the material is confusing but he takes the time to help you understand! he knows his stuff since he is an accountant and only teaches one class on the side! I highly recommend!

His lectures are very clear. He gives you homework and also solves the HW problems in the classroom so you can see were you went wrong if you did. Overall very good quality professor.
