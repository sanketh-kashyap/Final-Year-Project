Art  Kazmierczak,Northwest Arkansas Community College,Computer Science department, Bentonville, AR,4,3.6,N/A,1.6,,7,04/04/2013,NTWK2023,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,1,This is higher education. Art presents the material and there are weekly labs to turn in. He doesn\'t spoon feed learners nor make you work on useless material. If you need someone to hold your hand go elsewhere. If self-motivated adult Art is a near perfect teacher.

Just read the step by step instructions in the book and you\'ll do fine. No tests or quizzes. Just the tutorial and two case studies to complete each week, and he gives you an extra week to turn it in. He can be grouchy but hes funny too."

He is sarcastic but funny, and very laid back teacher with a positive approach. Never lets you be negative and will go the mile to help you understand the material. No tests, just do the work turn it in. Easiest and best class i\'ve ever taken. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

But as the semester went on I actually needed up liking him. Yes he doesn\'t do tests. No he doesn\'t have homework for you or than your programs. But isn\'t that just about a dream Prof!?

He goes over the chapter at the beginning of class and that\'s all there is to it. You practically teach yourself the material."
