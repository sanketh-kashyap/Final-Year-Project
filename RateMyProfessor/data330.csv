If it doesnt fit her requirements she will mark you down heavily. She requires discussion board posts every week and occasionally longer assignments. Her class is so much work and not worth the time. I spent more time on this class than my major classes. She also will not reason with you with any grade. Dont take her

It was a fine class, lots of reading and writing which is expected of English courses. Overall it was not too difficult and I did not feel I had to try too hard to get an A."
