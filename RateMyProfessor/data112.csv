You have the chance to grow a lot in this class, but not if you slack on your work! He is very supportive of student\'s work and will give you specific direction on how to improve, and you will, if you are willing to listen. : )"

Work must be clean and detailed flawlessly. There\'s no way you can get an A in this class without spending at least four hours on each homework assignment. The blending and idea process takes time. He\'s a seasoned funny experienced professor. Pay attention and don\'t slack. You\'ll learn a lot.

He is a tough grader but you will learn from him. He has a great career behind him and is very supportive and shares anything he thinks will help you. Very cool man.

But it was nice to hear about his career in the creative ad world and how the profession has changed."
