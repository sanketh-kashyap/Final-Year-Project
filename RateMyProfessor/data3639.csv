Make sure you study, and memorize all the notes he gives you. He is really funny, and the class is pretty interesting."

He does a good job of explaining difficult things and teaching, especially when students ask questions. The downside of this is that he is often very long-winded. He really knows his stuff, but he tends to give a long lecture (1hr +) before lab"

PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,"Dr. Neibergall was a good professor, but could get confusing at times. If you go to class and participate you will do fine. He requires Mastering chem, which takes about 30 minutes, due every class period, which is difficult but is pretty standard here at bethel."

Obviously it is going to be harder than you are used to! He was very helpful whenever I had a question and explained things well. I am not great at Chemistry and still did just fine! He also had a cool way of incorporating faith into learning science.

He tried to make everything as clear as possible and was very open and willing to help the students who were struggling. He always told us what we needed to study for tests. I would recommend him to other nursing students.

He will help you out if you are truly interested in learning the material. He is also one of the nicest profs I have had so just talk to him if you have any problems. He would love to help you!

Actually sent me an e-mail telling me because I couldn\'t figure out the answer to his homework question I was going to be a bad nurse (Im now in the honor\'s program). Lots of troubles with this professor, I definitely recommend avoiding his class at all costs."

He is always prepared and has very helpful notes. He types them out and you fill in blanks so you can pay attention and follow along at the same time instead of writing all the notes down. He is very nice and very approachable for help. General chemistry is never fun, but the class was not hard"
