She often put assignments up at 10 pm and had them due the next day at 12:30 without any notice. Very unclear on how to write the final group project and incredibly judgmental. Seems like an Easy A, but you have to really work for it."

She\'s literally the worst. Each week a group present\'s, which is Ford\'s way of not having to teach. Final paper 100% tailored to those who work in HR; totally incapable of writing it if you dont. DB\'s worth an insane 40% which essentially means you don\'t have to learn, just be active."

I love her and her class. I adore it the class it is so interesting! She is English so her accent is awesome, but beyond that she has so much life experience and knows the field she works in. Always willing to help you, and is crystal clear about stuff that needs to be done. I love her"

Yes, she can be a little unorganized which is quite funny considering the course, but she\'s great. Don\'t get discouraged by other posts. Exams can be a little tricky, but she will throw a question out if the majority got it wrong. Very down to earth, and makes class fun."

Class is pretty easy but a lot of reading (you can get by not doing it all). One midterm and one final which are pretty easy if your study well. Two papers which and a presentation which are BS. Very unorganized which is frustrating and surprising for a MANAGMENT professor
