The classes consisted of movies, two hour discussions on one topic with him giving multiple examples. The papers were a bit confusing because he was never quite clear on what he expected. No tests, just three papers and 1 group project. Laid back class other than the three papers."

The research paper will take A LOT of your time outside class. Start as early as possible. He\'s not a hard grader as long as you can write a good APA research paper (20+ pages). No other projects/assignments toward your final grade."
