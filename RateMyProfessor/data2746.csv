His manner of teaching and explaining certain concepts conveys his deep passion for the material. Extremely funny guy if you have an open sense of humor. Other than that he\'s been a great inspiration and possibly looking into land ecology because of him.

He loves research, the field. His lectures may come off as boring to some because it is so full of info, but it is that way because of his interest. He curves and usually is at his office if you need any help. 3 exams, Quiz once a week, presentation on species."

Overall, it\'s not a bad class. It can be very, very dry but he does his hardest to make it interesting. You NEED to have the book because its supports his PowerPoints. A few exams and a presentation determined my grade. Was it hard this class? No, but you need to have an interest in it like I do."

He talks about nothing relevant to the 21st century and attending his class is like watching paint dry on a wall. He is VERY boring and should not be allowed to teach anyone let alone Graduate students"
