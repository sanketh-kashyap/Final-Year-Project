Knows his stuff and knows how tough the life of a student can get with a full class load. Expects the world from his students but is willing to go the extra mile to help them achieve it. Would be a great permanent edition!!

Very helpful, clear, and knowledgeable. Spends a lot of time outside of class helping students. Passionate about the subject, and if you put the time in, you will learn a lot! Attending open lab is highly recommended. Put some time and effort into your grinder and you will do well!"

I can\'t believe he has not been hired full time yet. This class is awesome! It is a huge amount of work but as long as you attend open lab and work as much as possible you will do fine.
