Yost is very committed to her students and is VERY excited about the material. So excited that it will tune up your excitement for plants! She gives a lot of good examples and is very straight forward. Before I took the class I was loathing the plant section but she completely changed that.Recommended you take HER class.

The plant portion is not that difficult to understand. All you need to do is pay attention which is not hard since Jenn is so enthusiastic and funny that it\'s impossible for you to fall asleep in class. You can tell she really enjoys teaching this subject. I recommend taking her.
