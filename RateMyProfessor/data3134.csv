Kyle  Barret,Auburn University,Biology department, Auburn, AL,0,3.7,N/A,3.0,,3,05/07/2009,BIOL1000,3.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,He is really really nice and pretty funny. He tries hard to relate to students in class but sometimes you get really confused. His lectures typically dont make sense though he is willing to explain it again. Get U-Notes for sure! He is really hard. Everyone I know is suffering so I would recommend another teacher if possible :)

He does whatever possible to help his students out. PLEASE ATTEND HIS LECTURES B/C THEY ARE VERY HELPFUL ON THE TESTS. READ THE BOOK ALSO.
