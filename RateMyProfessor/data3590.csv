Geri  Doran,University of Oregon,Writing department, Eugene, OR,4,4.2,N/A,4.0,,3,01/02/2013,CRWR240,2.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Geri is a skilled writer, no doubt. She was helpful during office hour, but in lecture seemed condescending. Geri ""disagrees"" often, then proceeds to paraphrase the point exactly but with more elegance. I found this unproductive and dogmatizing. Where she was unable to out-do with language, she was dismissive of the unfamiliar."

Whether you are a creative writer or not, she will keep you absolutely engaged. She is very talented, and although she is not the type to push her own works on a class, I would recommend reading her collection Resin. She is definitely a challenging teacher and a difficult grader, but fair. TAKE HER CLASSES!"

She is a wonderful poet on top of being a wonderful teacher. She is great at explaining things that people don\'t understand, and she was able to get me interested in allegory, which I would have thought previously impossible."
