The one-on-one meetings to discuss my papers were some of the most constructive experiences that I had at university. My writing certainly improved because of her. That being said, don\'t take her course if you aren\'t prepared to work!"

Her class is daunting at the beginning, however it becomes crystal clear as the year progresses. Anyone who is interested in time/space and the functioning of power in society and doesn\'t take her class is missing out. She makes time to discuss papers with students individually. This is very helpful."
