I think he is a funny and nice person, it\'s just the subject matter is so boring and extensive that it\'s impossible not to zone out. He\'s not great at explaining concepts, but if you tell him you don\'t understand, he\'ll try to explain it until you get it. Tests are nothing you\'d expect and he never updates grades."

Let me just say I learned nothing from her! I learned how one person can be very conceited tehn try to make themselves out to be the best person in the world because they feel that being difficult and failing students is just waaay cool! She is a waste of time!!

He knows all the theories and concepts backwards/forward inside and out plus also know how science plays out in the real work world. He is possibly the best rounded person I have ever met.

He may be the best read person I ever met. Usually has things well planned out for class, but his energy level fades by the end of the week.

Follow study guide & you will do fine. Although for stats & using a program called SPSS, he doesn\'t really teach you the indepth stuff about the program that he sometimes asks for on the home work. Class is required & I should come out with an A or B so no complaints.2nd time I\'ve had this teacher (2 diff. classes)"

Should be an easy read of study guide not all emphasis on thinking about this stuff so deeply. who ever really uses this stuff anyway? why is this class required? too hard and not related to anything in the real world.
