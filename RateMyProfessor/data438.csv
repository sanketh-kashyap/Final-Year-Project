This was my only animal science class but it gave me a very good overview of topics that came into play in my classes for environmental science and zoology.

There is no textbook -- the lecture notes ARE the textbook -- so don\'t skip. Recitations can be boring, but some of the videos are good. Working as a group on the paper was awful. Overall I learned a lot in this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in animals."
