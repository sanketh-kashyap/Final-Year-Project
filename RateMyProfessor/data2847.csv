Sue  Hutton,Illinois State University,English department, Normal, IL,0,5.0,N/A,3.0,,1,02/05/2009,ENG301,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I find her class very interesting and helpful. Seemed like she knows material well and has a lot of experence in the classroom. Quickly responds to emails and very helpful with questions. Uses textbooks and often gives quizes (warns us before hand) Not a class you should walk into without being prepared. I would take another class from her.
