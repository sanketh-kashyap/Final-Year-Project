She has group meetings to have others help you with your paper and I believe that it was very beneficial. If you complete her notebook homework you should be fine.

She cant teach for her life. Basically you write a paper and shell tell you it sucks, the one paper was just about who are we are a writer... Im a history major. Im not a writer. Do not take her, you will hate life."

The classes were twice a week for 3 hours, and they were not as painful as expected because Chong had many assignments planned for the class."

Only thing is that students are not engaged in participating as the class itself is very boring. Other than that, I don\'t have an issue with this class."

I didn\'t learn anything about my writing and I didn\'t improve either. She\'s a nice woman but her class is obnoxiously boring and useless.

If not, you may not do so well although the chapter summary project is a big part of your grade and an easy way to do well. She puts a strict limit on absences, but almost always let class out early. Definitely recommend!"

The only homework you receive is journal entries and as long as you keep up with them you are fine. Essays are interesting to write about and the class goes by very fast!
