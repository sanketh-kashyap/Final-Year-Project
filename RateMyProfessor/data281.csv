Always knew what to expect. Must listen to and discuss many pieces of music,read text and analyze listening guides. Very educational & enjoyed this class beyond measure. Dr. Severtson is very interested in students\' learning and success. Class wasn\'t easy but took effort. Would do it again."

Kinda dorky but in a cute way. If you go to all the classes he gives you test questions in class. If you go to every class you can get a good grade. Hardly use the book at all. Trys to get everyone an A but grades a little hard.
