Geisbauer is where it\'s at as far as WLA science teachers. No need to buy the book - tests are straight out of notes. You can rent any Physio book if you want to read more. Write down and learn anything she puts on the board, those are the short answer responses. Explains things nicely and gives students plenty of chances to get an A!"

For exams, I was disappointed that I knew more info than what was actually tested. Additionally, she tends to babble about her personal life & goes off on random tangents which made the class lag behind a bit. An easy A."

She gives quizzes that are cumulitive to the finals and is very clear. Teaches with slides and very helpful when you need help after class.

Everyone should take her class for Anatomy and Physiology!"
