Amanda  Beeson,University of California San Diego,Mathematics department, La Jolla, CA,1,1.7,N/A,4.3,,3,12/21/2010,MTH161,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,She is very disorganized and skips over important steps. She spends more time defining concepts than actually doing problems. Her tests are very different that what she does in class. I would avoid her.

Both the prof and book skips vital steps. Class moves quickly. Some material you need to learn on your own, like matrices. She\'s nice and is more helpful in office hours. Overall I don\'t recommend her."

She is completely unclear and skips large amounts of information. She is still a graduate student so hopefully she will improve, but I found her class too stressful b/c the book for DE is unclear and she in know way makes it any more clear. I would not recommend her to anyone."
