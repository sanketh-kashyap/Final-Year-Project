David  Ho,Washington University in St. Louis,Biology department, St. Louis, MO,4,3.6,N/A,3.9,,15,05/09/2013,L41BIOL2960,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"Ho is very frank and understandibly this can be interpreted as sasiness. He is by far the best bio2960 lecturer. He explains tough concepts extremely well and has a great sense of humor. Ho makes himself very available outside of class, he wants everyone to suceed in the rather difficult course. ""Don\'t give it up, I will not give you up"" - Dr. Ho"

Ho emphasized a lot of concepts during his help sessions that were nowhere to be seen on his exams. Exam 2 was very hard so if by chance you can do well on it it\'ll help your grade. I can\'t wait to take my final and be done.

He\'s an expert in biology, and admits to being condescending, but he\'s a GREAT professor in a sense that he shares his knowledge with the class."

He will tell you that there is no necessity to memorize concepts, because they\'re ""intuitive and obvious,"" but for anyone who can\'t figure out complex chemical structures, it isn\'t. His tests are graded very harshly; he expects students to match the key."

I ended up doing well in the class, but I wish I\'d known earlier that the key is to memorize (basically sentence-by-sentence) the problem sets and test keys. He goes over things way too quickly in class though. It\'s a hard class and I really hated it and him. Only take it if you have to."

He is very engaging, and you really appreciate his humor and character once you have other personality-less professors."

It is hard to catch the important things he says because he talks quickly. He also can be a bit sadistic, but he is a better teacher than Majors. Make sure to go over the old exams and problem sets."

I honestly don\'t know how you couldn\'t understand him. I found him to be much better than Majors and actually explains the concepts, though sometimes he just skims over some things. The book does a great job of in-depth explanations though. He\'s always willing to help, and I found his class to be really interesting!"

His accent is absolutely incomprehensible. While that is to be expected at wash U to an extent, this is just over the line. Unfortunately, there arent many other options for bio majors than taking his class"

Tests graded very poorly - he says we don\'t have to memorize but if you want to do well on his tests memorize problem set answer keys and previous exams. He repeats q\'s and if you don\'t have EXACTLY what\'s on the answer key you will lose points (and that\'s not good)

Extremely precise in his choice of words - a very desirable trait in a Biology professor - and stressed key concepts repeatedly in lecture(""follow the carbons""). He was condescending to those who ask bad questions, though, and was often very cynical."

I found he was easier to understand than Mao and the TA\'s sessions answered any of my questions. Study problem sets and hw, keep up with reading and tests will be a breeze. Much clearer than Majors."
