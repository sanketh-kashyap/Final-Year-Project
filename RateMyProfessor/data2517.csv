Really good guy and very straight forward with everything he expects. Lectures can get dry once and a while but he always asks for input and things to make it better. One of the coolest things is he always relates the work to real life stuff. Great guy. Great professor!

He is very lecture heavy (explaining tests, quizzes, powerpoints) and doesn\'t stop until the end of class. The big part about getting a good grade with this professor is just turning stuff in and studying for tests, participation doesn\'t really seem to matter."

He reads straight off of a powerpoint and goes off on tangents pretty often. The tests are a lot harder than the material covered in class. You do a lot of group work.

The class is mostly power points which makes it kind of boring but it\'s nice because he posts them online as well. Tiahnybok is a super nice guy and I would recommend him if you wanted an easy class :)
