He\'s kinda goofy and he get soooo... excited about the material he\'s teaching. I thought his passion for the subject was great and made his class more enjoyable. His grading critiques are a bit vague and somewhat unclear at times, but he seems to be a pretty fair grader most of the time. Overall-good class!"

I wouldn\'t recommend taking a large lecture class from him as it could get boring. But, in a 40 person or less class, he is a good professor. Really interesting guy just to sit down and talk to, also really knowledgeable in journalism and a very fair grader. You give to the class, he gives back."
