Travis  Lovejoy,Ohio University,Psychology department, Athens, OH,0,5.0,N/A,3.0,,1,05/26/2010,PSY332,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Travis is very passionate about what he teaches, and he makes it very interesting. Presentations are graded very leniently and tests aren\'t too bad, but you do need to study for them. I would definitely take him again."
