It does however relate to every chapter we cover. She\'s been around the business and knows her stuff. Highly recommend for networking purposes. Our midterm consisted of 5 multiple choice questions. Maybe it was rushed because I took it during winter semester, but the group project was very simple. Easy A if you show up and show interest. If you get a C in her class, you hate kids!"

Just read the book, 99% of the tests are book related. Gives you a study quide before any tests. Talks alot about her life but goes well with what we are studying. Great professor."
