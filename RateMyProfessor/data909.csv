Her assignments aren\'t hard, and if you\'re paying attention in class, her tests aren\'t too extremely difficult either. Overall I felt like I learned a lot from this history class."

She warns you what will on midterms/finals and she gives you decent time to finish assignments. I took her African class, her first take on the class, so she was a bit easier on us than her other classes. I learned a lot from her, and I really enjoyed the class."

She barely uses the textbook, everything you need to know for tests is on the lectures/powerpoints. Before big tests she gives a powerpoint with everything you need to study. Videos are interesting and projects are not huge."

Very minimal use of the textbook - she makes a lecture outline available for students to print out. Only downsides are the group projects... they\'re due the last day of class when you have other finals to work on.

I felt she understands students. She has great passion so the subjects are fun and all assignments are super clear, only a moron would not understand her expectations. Awesome teacher! homework made me do well on tests. super helpful with my questions.can\'t wait for ah 220 ;>"

She is not helpful unless you are one of her favorites, i.e. ask useless questions about even more useless information. The assignments are a waste of time and the project is even moreso. She is a horrible teacher!!"
