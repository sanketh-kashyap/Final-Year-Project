Karen  Bond,The Art Institute of Pittsburgh (All),Law department, Pittsburgh, PA,0,5.0,N/A,1.0,,2,02/03/2009,FND250,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Don\'t even think about not reading the book! As a lawyer she knows BS when she reads it and you aren\'t going to put one over on her. Awesome instructor who really helped me when I lost my mother the second week of the course. I\'ve decided to go on to law school as a result of her passion for the law and her ability to relate law to life.

Awesome instructor who will go the extra mile to help you out. I took her course online. She made herself available by phone, email and online to her students. If you want to learn the subject from someone who cares I\'d definitely recommend Professor Bond."
