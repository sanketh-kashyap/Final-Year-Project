He was one of the most organized, thoughtful, and open-minded professors I\'ve had. Definitely do all the readings as the class is paper based. He does not give in-class exams which is nice because you can work on the exams at home. I would take a class with him again! Really nice man!"

He takes an already boring topic (history and schools of psychology) and makes it even MORE boring. Clearly enjoys the sound of his own voice. Tests are hard and he gives out a ""study guide"" that covers essentially every tiny detail. Useless."

Very passionate & extremely helpful. Can be very redundant in the way he speaks though, but I learned a lot! He asks great questions. No tests, just lots of little papers and one big paper! Readings are ALWAYS interesting!"
