Class was easy but uninformative and often tense for me as an LGBTQ student of color. Other peers have expressed similar discomfort. The guest lecturers Beth invited offered dated perspectives on queer, feminist, religious and cultural theory without adequate critique."

Although I\'m an artist myself, lecture was often boring and drawn out. Her class was late at night, so often only about a fourth of the class would show up. Grading is based on weekly 1-page paper, not bad. Skim the readings. She randomly began taking attendance after the midterm."
