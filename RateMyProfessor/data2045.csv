Ms. Rettich picks favorites from her old class and gives the ""troublemakers"" more freebies and privileges than the other students who actually try. Always late on grading and not understanding of student needs at all."

She doesn\'t have a mono tone and she can teach one on one if she has to. She puts in time for all the students and has even offered to help students after class if need be. she a little strict which is a good quality in a professor and she interacts with the class.

Extremely boring and not very helpful. This professor thinks your world revolves around her class. No make up for anything although, she is late with grading things herself. I would not take her again if possible."

When I saw she was teaching English in college as well, I immediately signed up. She\'s a really respectful woman, awesome awesome. The only downside to it was that I felt like I was in high school again. And if you know anything about English, I\'d say she\'s very easy. Unless you want a challenge."
