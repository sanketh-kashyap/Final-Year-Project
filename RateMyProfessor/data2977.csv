Most of the actual subject of the lesson gets lost in his constant off topic banter, which is more often than not, more interesting than the academic subject itself. After taking multiple classes with Alan I have many water cooler conversation starters."

What needs to be learned during a class period will be taught, but he has a tendency to babble a bit. He assigned reading and a few assignments out of the book but other than that, I barely opened the thing."
