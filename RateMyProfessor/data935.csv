Teacher will know who puts effort and understands the material. She can be face paced, but that\'s just part of college. Read ahead, focus, and ask question once not sure about something. In chemistry every chapter is essential and comes back to haunt."

Many people complain about her but its only because they don\'t study and expect her to give them an easy grade. Students at trade tech need to grow up and get with it. Chemistry is a difficult subject...but she brings it to a level to understa
