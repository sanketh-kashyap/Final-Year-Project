She comes off as a ""firm teacher""(Not Really). She cares that you learn and will receive late homework. if you pay attention you will walk out with all the tools necessary to pursue the next class with confidence. GOOD LUCK!"

She helped me to improve my punctuation, grammar, and even speaking. Thanks to her, I managed to skip the next level, AELW940, and get straight into ENGL101. I suggest you choosing this and Prof. Wowk\'s classes if you were placed in AELR930 as well."
