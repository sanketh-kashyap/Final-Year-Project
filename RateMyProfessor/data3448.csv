Darcie  Sparks,University of Saskatchewan,Nursing department, Saskatoon, SK,9,3.1,N/A,2.3,GRADED BY FEW THINGS (3)  Tough Grader (2)  Caring (1)  Respected (1)  Inspirational (1),9,01/14/2018,NURS200,1.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,No,N/A,TOUGH GRADER  GRADED BY FEW THINGS,2,0,"Probably an excellent nurse, as others have mentioned, but not a professor. Slides were very vague and usually just of pictures, then she would ramble on for 10 minutes about something, making it difficult to determine what material is testable and what is important. Doesn\'t properly follow marking rubric and emails were passive aggressive."

Not a great professor. Too bad you don\'t get a chance to pick if you want her as a prof or not. I hope and pray that I don\'t have any more classes with her.

She would often contradict herself and was unreliable. Her slides were terrible and during her lectures, she would often read the words or acronyms without talking about them or telling us what the acronyms meant. She was rude in responding to her emails. Overall, I would not recommend her as a professor."

She cares about students like patients and makes you want to be a better nurse for your patients. She mentors you and really helps if you have any questions. She explains concepts applicable to clinical to make sure you understand. She is nice and easygoing but expects you to do your best and support/empower your pts
