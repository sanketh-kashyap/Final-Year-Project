Ian  Fermandapulle,Queensborough Community College,Biology department, Bayside, NY,9,2.0,N/A,3.8,Tough Grader (1),4,04/29/2018,BIO302,2.0,4.0,N/A,Yes,No,N/A,TOUGH GRADER,0,0,Took Fernandopulle in City Tech for Microbiology (summer semester) he was SO arrogant. He spent more time talking about himself than he did teaching. His tests were confusing and often had little to do with what he focused on in class. Only perk is that he writes awesome letters of recommendation for grad school.

He admits to teaching at several schools, never uses a textbook, confuses classes. His notes are constantly being corrected due to his error. Leaves students very confused. Tests require advanced knowledge of course materials. Very tempermental."
