She acknowledges and respects that most of her students are working and studying and caring for family. The course syllabus is demanding, but she did what she could to accommodate student needs. She encouraged students to set high standards for themselves."

It\'s hard to follow what she expects from the class or from individuals. I don\'t think she understands that we can\'t put 150% in one course, it\'s hard to balance her expectations with other courses."

This was a group learning process; if you get a good group, you\'ll enjoy the class. I really enjoyed the class, the materials, and Sharon\'s patience pedagogy."
