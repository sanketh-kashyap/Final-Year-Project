His directions are also confusing at times. Better to take him than Wilson because workload is so much less but if you can avoid the class all together, do it."

He is rude and is terrible at teaching. He says to ask questions, but when you do he tries to make you look dumb. He has an attitude and always thinks he is right. The class was pretty easy, but he makes it miserable. He also takes points off for the stupidest things. I do suggest taking h"

To me he was a very cool guy who kept his opinions to himself and tried to get the class to participate. The only time he would get upset in class is when the same people would constantly be late. If you\'re not a slacker, I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy his classes."

He gets mad at stupid stuff and he isn\'t that organzied. He can be a big jerk for no reason and he\'s really arrogant. I wouldn\'t take him again.

EXTREMELY opinionated. Couldn\'t even stand being in class, let alone participate."
