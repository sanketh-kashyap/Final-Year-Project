Her passion for education shows through her teaching. She practices what she preaches--the methods she teaches you are the methods she uses in class. She made a three hour lecture really interesting. The class relies on problem-based learning, so there is a lot of group work."

The class was interesting, but she was not. I found her grading to be really unfair, she was nice but I don\'t recommend this."
