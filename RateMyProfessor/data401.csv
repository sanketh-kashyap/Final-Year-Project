Definitely buy the workbook bc he based all of his hw assignments from it & you have to answer the books questions but didn\'t use the grammar one much, he tells you to reference it at times in class & if you don\'t have it no big deal bc its ""for your use"". Go to class bc you only have 2 free absences before it starts to count."

He may have treated students like children b/c they acted like it....I thought he was great.

People may feel they are treated like children. That could be that they act like children and must be treated that way. COME TO CLASS PEOPLE.

By that, I mean he treats everyone like a child and also has everyone read they\'re essays in front of the class. I never understood why."
