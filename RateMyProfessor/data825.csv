Ren  Guo,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Mathematics department, Minneapolis, MN,2,2.9,N/A,2.7,,9,05/19/2011,MATH2263,4.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"An excellent math professor! His lectures worked very well with the textbook. When the textbook didn\'t explain something clearly, his lecture did. His exams are reasonable, and he\'s a very intelligent and nice person. Highly recommended!"

He\'s smart and can answer any question you ask, the only trick is getting him to turn around from the chalkboard to answer it. He writes every step on the board so there\'s no chance you won\'t miss anything. Difficult to understand, but it\'s not a problem because math doesn\'t need a language."

He\'s slightly difficult to understand at first, but he writes absolutely every word he says on the board, so it\'s not really a major issue. He is very willing to go over any questions. Lecture attendance not mandatory as most of the material in lectures are examples from the text."

He does teach out of the textbook, but considering the tests are basically the problems he does and the textbook is written by a fellow professor, he does the best he can. The TA does most of the teaching anyways with any math class."

Explains thing alot better 1-on-1 than the lecture. if it wasnt for his notes on the board then lecture would suck. attending class is not mandatory because text has it all."

Not only is his English bad, but he\'s incredibly soft spoken. I sat in the second row and couldn\'t hear him! He did start using a microphone, but her was still hard to hear. If you have him, hope you have a good TA."

But it didn\'t matter, because his lecture were just doing the book examples on the board. I passed the class, but didn\'t learn anything."

However, he is very helpful if you go to his office hour. the text book is even worse than him."

Not only is his accent hard get through, he tends to mumble. His handwriting on the board isn\'t a whole lot better. He mostly just copied the book up on to the board anyways, so lectures were pretty much useless. Tests were fairly predictable though, and the curve was generous."
