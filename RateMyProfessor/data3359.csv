Class can go fast but Williams is good about answering questions office hours."

I feel most students would benefit if he spent more time explaining, however this class is obviously intended for high caliber students, and apparent in the way he teaches."

The homework and lectures sucked. He laughs at his own jokes when no one else does. E.g. ""Professor, what material can we expect to be covered on the exam?"" ""Macroeconomics LOLOLOL"". Absolute nightmare, professor. Avoid if possible."

Reads slides in a drone, reuses old hws, annoyed at questions, does not work through problems, makes exams that test algebra more than economics. In short: boring and useless. It\'s not difficult, but you don\'t have to learn anything to do well. Just regurgitate."

Grading is lenient but this material is tough and attending lecture is honestly about as helpful as reading the notes he posts online.

Some of the economics covered in this course is quite advanced, and often times he skips over some details. The homework problems are challenging (but rewarding), and the exams are fair. The power points are confusing, which makes studying for exams confusing and frustrating at times."

Williams reads power points. 90% of lecture is spent rambling over macro graphs. As for the math & concepts, which you\'ll be tested on, Wiliams mumbles something about it, waves his hands & flaps his arms & goes to the next slide, which will be another GDP graph."

Problem sets were graded very fairly. He realizes that you chose to take an honors course, and gave an extremely generous curve. I believe he mentioned average grade was an AB. Very intelligent, sometimes a rather dry lecturer but very helpful overall."

He\'s also apparently pretty popular as a researcher and economist. Teaching is not his forte, and in the end the students suffer for it."
