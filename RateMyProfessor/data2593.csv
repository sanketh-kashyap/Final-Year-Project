Very interesting topic delivered in an engaging fashion. Ultimately, the class is what you make of it, and I enjoy it. Her research seems very important and topical. The North is always in the news."

Gita is a great teacher and her classes are interesting. Relating material to her own research keeps the subject real, practical and memorable. I\'d definitely take more classes with her."

Tries and fails at engaging the class. Would have been better if the lectures actually related to the course and not her own academic research."

She tends to obscure her point behind confusing words and scholarly-like ramblings, which make it hard to glean much information. Organization of her lectures and slides are quite good, and she is helpful and approachable."
