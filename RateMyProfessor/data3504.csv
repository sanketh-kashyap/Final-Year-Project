Rarely homework. If you do have homework, it\'s work you haven\'t finished in class. Great help, always clears things up if there is a problem."

There are no tests, just a few projects, short reflections, and an observation. Overall, the class was a lot of fun and she makes you look forward to having fun as a teacher. She\'s really nice and funny in her own way. She tries to keep the topics interesting."

Definitely an easy A if you go to class but it\'s a really useful class. Also, she\'s the education advisor so you get to know her too!"
