She basically is just reading someone else\'s powerpoints. She gives incorrect science information - even in her specialty. She always ended class early and assignments rarely made complete sense. It was annoying to pay so much for a class taught by this professor!

She reads off of the powerpoint slides and there is no need to go to the lectures. When it\'s time for test review she gets very cranky. The TA\'s are very helpful. The labs are easy but a waste of time. I wouldn\'t recommend this class. Take another NATS if you can.

There are 2 TA\'s that can answer questions. Overall, a good teacher and an average class."

I would recommend NOT taking one of her classes. She tells you one thing and then denies it later so she\'s a bit of a liar. No very helpful and she gets pissed off a lot. Overall, she is a bad professor. Stay away unless you like mean people."
