However, I can appreciate her teaching style but the solely peer-discussion based platform did not work for me. As well, I got an A on every assignment and still got a B+ in the class (and yes I did participate)."

She keeps the class engaging and interesting, but encourages a lot of class participation so speak up at least once per class if you\'re on the shy side."

Sometimes she will try too hard to make her students reach her thought process that she actually ends up confusing the class. Other than that, she is overall very helpful and will give you the grade you deserve."

You need to be able to speak up in class to be receptive to her though, which some students struggle with. Her class is very discussion oriented and though she seems disorganized at times she is not too difficult to follow."

I believe she has a solid grasp of her specialty subjects (Ancient, Aristotle, epistemology, 20th Analytic), but lacks the ability to confer her knowledge in a clear and consistent manner. Also, she ends up losing track of the syllabus as she lets the students decide the pace of the course."
