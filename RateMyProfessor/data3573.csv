He is arrogant and rude and in incessantly telling his students they are stupid. He is at Grenfell Campus Memorial University now. I love Earth Science courses and was going to do a minor until he started teaching all the classes. I refuse to take anything he teaches. 177"

He clearly knows a lot, but is incapable of teaching it. Arrogant and rude, not helpful at all. I\'m going to echo what everyone else said here...AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

He taught this class like it was a masters class at MIT rather than a 100 level class at OSU. He was arrogant, rude, and didn\'t help any student that needed it. His tests and slides cover completely different material and he doesn\'t curve. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"

Definately avoid him if you can, he is definately knowledgeable but does NOT do a good job conveying that knowledge to students, nor does he give a strong idea of what topics will be stressed heavily on the tests and which wont!

WORST professor I have EVER had (and I\'m a senior). Does not specify what is on the test, just says read, then when we all failed the test, he refused to curve it. Very rude, not helpful, stubborn, has no problem failing the whole class, doesn\'t use carmen, not cooperative, even his TAs have issues with him. AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
