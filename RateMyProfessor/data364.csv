It\'s simple. Do your work and you will gain a mastery of Hindi Language whilst getting the easiest A of your life. Do the work, and Sai will give the grade. Classes are fun, not too much of work, and engaging. I highly recommend."

She expects you to know all the vocabulary before she\'s even taught it to you. Highly disorganized. Nice person.

We learned less than 300 words the entire semester, didn\'t have test or syllabus until 4 weeks before the end of the semester, never had a textbook (and less than 5 handouts), and moved at a snails pace. Sai made fun of slow students and doesn\'t answer emails-- at all. Avoid class."

She has an amazing ability to on the spot create a whole lesson from one small comment or question from a student. The class was often the highlight of my day - a hilarious one that I will never forget."
