If you aren\'t one of her favorites, it\'s extremely likely that she won\'t help you. She is a very nice person though, and for the most part a good teacher. Just a very difficult class."

If you ask for tutoring and she doesn\'t favor you, she will recommend you to other tutors who are never there, when you should be learning from her and her teaching style, so you understand what\'s going on in class. DO NOT take this class. Quizzes every week that everyone fails & pointless workbook homework."
