He If you don\'t enjoy his class something is wrong with you. I don\'t like anthro but he makes it fun. TAKE HIS CLASSES"

I\'ve learned the most from him. He makes class fun. He really cares about his students and is more than willing to help them outside of the class room. He is also very funny it\'s hard to stop laughing. He is very intelligent.
