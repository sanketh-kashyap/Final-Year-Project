Earned A - She insisted I didn\'t although I had proof- told me no 1 rcvd A .Peers later conf there were in fact A\'s given. Had us work on a class project for weeks & then didnt grade it .Allowed unproductive , non essential chit chat to take over class when she was on break from ""tooting""her own horn. Lacks professionalism."
