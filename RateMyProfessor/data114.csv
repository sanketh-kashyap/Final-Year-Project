She\'s nice if she knows u work hard, shell answer any questions u have. There were 2 blue book exams (rather difficult). 4 Labs (all following the tutorials in arcgis so they\'re step by step). U also need to present on 2 journal articles and one huge final group project."

Has an accent and sometimes it is hard to understand her. The tests are hard but manageable. She is very knowledgeable and tries to help with what she can so you can learn. Not an easy class but very interesting.
