Her P/points are from the book. The reviews are useless. Read your emails TOO LATE if not delete them. Seems lost on all clases. Hopefully will NEVER take class with her again. Sorry if you get her.

Yes she did give only power points that got boring, but she knew her stuff and she gave AWESOME reviews for the test, they were long and detailed, but if you really studied them then you should have had no problem getting an A!!! You need to study for this class, no way around it!!"
