Ken  Johnson,Muscatine Community College,Science department, Muscatine, IA,8,2.9,N/A,4.0,Caring (1)  Inspirational (1)  Hilarious (1),4,01/29/2018,PHY171,5.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,Yes,A-,INSPIRATIONAL  CARING  HILARIOUS,1,0,I took a class with him several years ago. Im getting a masters in education and it got me thinking about the best teachers I had and ken was by far the best. Im horrible at science and he made is accessible to me. He gave time to me outside of class and used different teaching methods until I had an ah hah moment and suddenly it made sense

This was an online class that he copied from another professor and called his own (Obvious because several items through the course had old professor\'s name on it). Does not participate in online forums, does not inform students of grading reasons except a generic blanket voice message. Avoid"

I enjoyed it so much that I took physics II. Ken was a really great guy willing to help you anytime he was in for office hours. He made the information easily accessible so long as you can to class and copied his notes.

His tests are crazy hard. He allows you a note card, but it doesn\'t help. I never knew what he was going to test on. And when you go over 4 chapters with about 200 pages it is a lot to study. Nice guy though. He had to have majorly curved it in the end."
