Always has something interesting and is pretty casual with the class. He makes you feel like you\'re pals. However, he definitely needs to perfect his teaching skills in the way that he is very vague, doesn\'t tell you exactly what is expected on papers. He missed some appointments and is sometimes scatterbrained."
