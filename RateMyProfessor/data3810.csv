Kristen  Tobey,DePaul University,Religion department, Chicago, IL,2,4.4,N/A,3.8,,5,12/21/2011,RELG1021,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Very friendly and casual, keeps class debates flowing without dominating the conversation. She requires a lot of reading and very little to no written hw, but you do need to listen to her lectures in class and read the materials. She seems to love what shes teaching and isn\'t condescending"

It seems like many of the topics we discuss are the same things over and over again. The class itself is interesting and Tobey is a good professor compared to many L&S teachers.

The texts are PDFs and books - interesting and you will learn something new. Participation and attendance are important. Wrote 2 papers, 1 project, and 1 oral presentation. You will do well if you do the work and pay attention to her lectures."

She presented herself in a clear and concise manner, exposed different viewpoints and theories in the evolution of religion in America, and allowed us to do our own presentations on current issues that surround religion. The readings were engaging for the most part, however, sometimes hard to understand (old colonial English language)."

The material is really boring and she doesn\'t do a whole lot to help that. Its basically straight lecture all the time. Also, if you don\'t do all of the reading you will have a hard time in her class. Lectures, papers, test, etc. are all on the readings."
