Margaret  Voss,Pennsylvania State University - Erie,Biology department, Erie, PA,3,4.6,N/A,2.4,,7,08/13/2012,BIO110S,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"She is very helpful and a sweet woman! Personally, I didn\'t go to every class but if you just ask her what is going to be on the test and actually study, the tests are easy to ace. She is very clear in her lectures and most of what she says in class is on the tests. She also gives a lot of extra credit! Take her!!"

Having her in lacture and lab is a delight. She is a great person and is always willing to help."

She knows her material but does not communicate it well. Favors some students over others

She\'s a great teacher, helpful, and always makes time for students outside of class. She\'s amazing to listen to too- absolutely brilliant person."

She is extremely intellegent and truely cares about her students. I would recommend one of her classes to any bio major in a heartbeat.

She is simply the best and I just can\'t say enough good things about her. She\'s ridiculously brilliant, helpful, and sweet. She\'s practically the only thing making my transfer to Behrend bearable."

She gives the information, provides examples, and expects students to read the book and keep on track with the material. She challenges her students and expects them to learn, enjoy, and remember the material she teaches. As long as you truly love biology she is an AWESOME teacher! I will never forget he lessons!"
