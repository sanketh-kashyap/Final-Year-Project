I feel Prof Blackburn did an excellent job at focusing the class on the basic, yet, vital principals of academic writing. At times the course was challenging, but nothing more than you would expect from an undergraduate course at an institution such as De Paul."

Although it can be really easy if you keep up with the work, she teaches nothing. This class is suppose to be a research base class but instead we read a book that has to do nothing with the class. There is a lot of busy work, quiz every class. Save yourself the trouble and don\'t take her."
