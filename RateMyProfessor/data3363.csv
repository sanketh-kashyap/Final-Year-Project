I have got an A easily. he is extremely helpful and gives the material that will be on exams.

I would not say that tests are super hard - just too many students simply do not get accounting, and need to change their major."

He is a student teacher without a clue. He is BORING. He reads the powerpoint slides. He does not go over tests and he expects you to go to his office if you want to review what you got wrong.

Words can\'t express how horrible this professor is. The class spent more time correcting him (on the subject!) than he did actually ""teaching"". He wrote notes on the board and asked us to copy- those were his lectures. I don\'t think he fully understands the subject himself..."

The theoric questions of the exams are very tricky, and always give you a problem that counts for 60% of the test. Good Luck!!!"

He does not know how to engage his students and does not prepare you for the exams. His exams are all calculations; which he does not cover in class. He only reviews homework and reads from powerpoints. If you can avoid his class at all... and I do mean all cost.

He really doesn\'t teach the material - just reviews homework assignments. Very boring lecture; extreamly monitone. Do not take this course with this professor if you want to learn the material. His exams are all calculation; only gives two minutes per question on the final. :("
