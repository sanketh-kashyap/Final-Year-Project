She also assumes all ic kids are rich and uses ""white"" and ""privileged"" synonymously."

Is a tough grader especially on written work, but the content you learn is worth it. I would definitely take a class with this professor again."

Her tests were kind of hard, but she tells you what to study. She paced the class well and had interesting in-class projects. Some of the assignments were cool, too. She\'s a harsh grader but I learned a lot and I really liked the class :-) I would recommend it"

She tells you exactly what to expect and challenges you to connect with the material. She is well organized and engaging. She is extremely helpful and understanding. Taking 3 courses with her has been invaluable to my degree.

I can tell she was struggling to try and make the class interesting but for the most part she just put the lecture hall to sleep. Her grading is harsh - her instructions often contradict the rubric. I once got marked off for lack of citations in an assignment that supposedly did not require any.

I took this course fall 2008 and I learned more about the conceptualization of drugs in the U.S., policies that were created in the U.S. and internationally. I recommend the class."
