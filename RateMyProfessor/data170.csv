Absolutely hilarious, will spend half of class telling jokes and showing comic strips, he\'s the cutest old man ever!

He has swag like there is no tomorrow. Remember Vanilla Ice back in the day? Times that swag by 100 and you have the new age Green Vanilla Ice. He always dresses to impress, and is never fashionably late. Mr. Green shouldn\'t teach just english. He should teach life as we live it. Even Jesus recommends this class."

Really gets into teaching and love telling jokes that no one laughs at but him. Does a lot of in class activities (i.e. crosswords). Doesn\'t always explain what he wants very well and will let you revise your essays for a higher grade.
