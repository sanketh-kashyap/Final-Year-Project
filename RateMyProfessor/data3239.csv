I\'ve definitely have had better but I\'ve also had worse. She doesn\'t believe in 100% so don\'t count on it. The highest grade I got on an essay was 95 but I got an A so she gives you opportunities. Also don\'t count on her to give you clear advise

Her and her assistant just sat in front of the class most of the time with and only taught 10 minute lectures. Not clear at all and hardly communicated.

Very little was learned, despite actually doing research papers. Easy 3.0+ if you take the lab class and stay on task. Never used book or packet, which was a waste of $40."

I felt like i was writing a high school paper not a college one.
