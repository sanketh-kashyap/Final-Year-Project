Not helpful, doesn\'t care to help/teach, nothing is ever her fault, condescending comments made to students. Referred to one student as ""stupid"" & don\'t ever wear pink to her class, it\'s ""hideous"" & she will make that known. Unfortunately she teaches too many classes."

She pushes you to work your hardest and be the best nurse you can be! And she is ALWAYS there to offer a helping hand if you are willing to put forth the effort and time needed in nursing school.Overall an awesome teacher who truly cares for her students and wants them to succeed as quality nurses!

She never responds to e-mails and when she does she doesn\'t address the content. She favors students and picks ones to fail. For a teacher, she seems to hate students. She needs to leave the teaching scene."

Pharm was extremely hard, and I did not feel like I could look to her for help. Mental health was a whole other story. The tests were a joke, but she was very fair in correcting her mistakes, however...nothing is ever her fault."
