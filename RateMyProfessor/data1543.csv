PARTICIPATION MATTERS,1,1,"Ding Ding wasn\'t always clear with what he was saying. He knew his stuff but sometimes failed to explain things well. He would say things like ""you know"" and leave the rest of the problem for you to do later. My big issue is that the class grades would change: HW was 30% but then became 5. We never got hw, which hurt my grade because of the tests."

He is not strict like the others. The earlier comments on here were talking about a heavy accent but I think it got a little better. I could understand him. Try to take his class. He is funny and tries to help you when you ask for it.

This guy is a godsend compared to the other calc 2 teachers. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS TESTS AND DO WELL CUZ THE MIDTERM AND FINAL ARE WAY HARDER.

His accent is hard at times to understand, but he knows how to teach and based on what I hear about other professors, he teaches better than the rest. The 2 tests that he makes himself are not bad, but the midterm and final are hard, but you cant do anything about that."

But then I realized that all the math TA\'s are on a really strict syllabus. He\'s really nice and he takes into account what you don\'t want on tests. He\'s definitely a good teacher!

Tries his best to explain the material. Teaches from the Textbook. Doesn\'t take attendance. Very chill in terms of teaching. Is able to speak Chinese if your English is horrible.
