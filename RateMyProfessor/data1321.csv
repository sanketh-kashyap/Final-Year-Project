Edmond  Gurdo,Wilmington University,Education department, New Castle, DE,5,4.7,N/A,1.8,,6,12/21/2014,PSY340,5.0,3.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Dr. Gurdo is my favorite professor by far. I was a bit nervous coming into this research class but Dr. Gurdo made the topic of research an enjoyable one and used real-life scenarios to really boost my interest as well as my realization for research in the field of psychology. He responded to emails quickly and provided very useful feedback.

He is young and knows what it is like to sit in a class - 2 test which were very easy, 1 group project and literature paper- he makes it worthwile coming to class and plus he wasn\'t that bad to stare at!"

His assignments are clear, if you print the pp slides & take notes you will do fine on his tests. One paper, 2 test, 1 group presentation. He is the BOMB!!!"

The paper did not make much sense. But it was his first time teaching this class. I will rate him a 4.
