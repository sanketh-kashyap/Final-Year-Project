I couldn\'t understand her because of her heavy accent. She copied and pasted the textbook on to her power points and often looked at them as if it were new information to her. She never posted grades on blackboard and took forever to put the lectures on it. Avoid her class like the plague!

However, she is very unorganized and her lectures can be very hard to follow. The class work load was not too bad, and tests were somewhat easy, but that was only because I studied the book and not from her lectures."

Not clear, partial language barrier-she says things backwards! Don\'t try and write on evolution for your paper she will tell you she is going to be MORE critical on your paper than the rest of the class (especially if you wish to present both sides or don\'t believe in evolution). Spends most of the class just trying to explain"
