DO NOT take this teacher! She is terrible. If you answer a question wrong, or ask a question, she responds like youre an idiot. Also, for exams, she provides no clue of what will be on them. Everyday in class is the same boring thing: a power point presentation. Stay away!!"

She\'s very strict with the homework and assigments being turned in and attendence is mandatory. She also expects us to make our own study guides for midterms/finals when we have zero idea what the test is going to be like. She should make one! Overall I liked the course material not the teacher!

You cannot miss class at all. You need to keep up with the readings every week because the tests are built from them but they aren\'t bad at all. 500-800 word paper due every week. In a nutshell, read the assignments, write the papers, and go to class you\'ll get an A."

She\'s very strict about attendence and if you\'re more than a couple of minutes late she wont allow you to sign in! You\'ll DEFINITELY need to be on top of the readings. The tests aren\'t that bad, but if you want to pass you\'ll HAVE to do the reading. DO NOT miss or be late to any classes or assignments! It will affect you grade average."
