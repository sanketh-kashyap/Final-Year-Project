Although he is a bit difficult to understand, he got the job done. His quizzes and exams are straight forward, just do the homework he assigns and you\'ll be fine. He let us turn in homework for points and we had a take home exam. He made a difficult class manageable, highly recommended."

Make sure you prepare for the final, go over previous finals from years before to know the pormat and similar questions that are going to be on there."

If you do the homework and study a couple hours a week you\'ll do fine on his exams and quizzes. He explains everything in great detail in lecture unlike other teachers at Wayne. One of the best professors I ever had. What\'s tough about the class is the departmental final, so give yourself time to prepare."
