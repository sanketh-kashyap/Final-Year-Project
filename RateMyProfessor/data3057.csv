He always says to read the chapter, but he never spend more than 5 min to teach us, .He speaks really lower than usual, so we can not understanding what he is saying. I did not learning anything with him. I feel bad but, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS."

I wouldn\'t recommend it. I will admit that he knows his history, but he\'s so so unorganized and unclear. He collects homework and will work with you to pass his class. However, he doesn\'t follow the syllabus and did pop-tests for the 4 out of the 5 tests that we took. I didn\'t like his class."

Don\'t take his class if you are not willing to do the reading and hw. you will fail :( However a good grade comes easily for those who work for it.

Class involves a lot of reading and review questions. You will take about for 4 test/quizzes a midterm and final. Also have to do a presentation on a topic related to the class and hand in a 3 page paper on your topic. If you like history you will be ok, but if you don\'t, it can be very boring..."

I dont like professors who just lecture, lecture, lecture. He seemed to try to get the class involved a little bit, but they were not really too up for it. He also added other random questions that were NOT in the textbook, I have no idea why. Take his class at your own risk!!"

He talks low and he is not prepare for class or the assignment that he gives. but I can not tell you how this class ends because I switched teachers before it can get any worst. I hate his teaching style.

The topics weren\'t even in the book. He does not teach from the book but from outside sources. He does not speak in complete thoughts, mumbles and gets mad when you ask him to repeat something."
