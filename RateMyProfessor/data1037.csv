In spite of his situation, he is very knowledgeable when it comes to programming. He is very helpful. The only negative I can say is his accent. There are times that I cannot understand what he says. Overall, he is a good teacher."

The reason I can evaluate him because I was a software engineer, briefly: 1. His topic is very useful and critical to programing. 2. He has hands on experiences so he know how to teach instead of talking. 3. Normally if you do not have any background before, this course is difficult."
