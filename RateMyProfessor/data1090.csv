Her class at first seems intimidating because of how much she knows about the law, but I thoroughly enjoyed the semester with her and would jump at the chance to get to take another class with her."

Class is interesting, she expects actual class contribution (will silence the ramblers) but rarely cold calls, and she puts real effort into helping her students both in and out of class.

Very organized and coherent lectures, takes attendance and is socratic, and controls class coversations leading to engaging experience. Very nice and genuine person, such an asset to ASU!"
