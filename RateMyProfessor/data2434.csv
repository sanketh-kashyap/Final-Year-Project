The project takes for ever and the homework can be time consuming becasue he doesn\'t really go over it much in class. But I got an A- without much effort. Make sure you attend class, it is mandatory"

I was having a terrible time until i went to his office hours then he helped out a lot! His accent is extremely hard to understand

Not being mean but you cannot understand anything he says!!!!! Which leads to lots of confusion come project time, stupid stupid stupid. Wish I could drop but this class is mandatory."

I think it was a great course. It helped me understand a lot more technical terms and was not a hard course to take at all. all the assignments were enjoyable. I learned a new programing language. now i know how to build user interfaces and websites.

His grading is purely however he feels at any given time. His lectures are uninspired and as dry as the Mohave; perhaps imagine a Chinese Ben Stein, only somehow less interesting. Profs like this are the reason the MIS department is a laughing stock of the CoB. He needs to go, the class is a joke."

Having had to work in a corporation this summer where Microsoft is king, the knowledge acquired here helped out immensely. A wide array of programming topics beyond a beginner\'s curriculum was offered, and the professor was always willing to help whenever it was needed."

The tests were easy. The project is the most difficult thing about this class and even that wasn\'t difficult as we went over how to do everything in class. The professor answered any questions that were brought up in class. Show up and do the work and this class will be no problem.

I am not sure how he ever got the position. You cannot understand a word his says due to his inability to speak English. His tests and quizzes are ridiculously hard. On the semester long project he does not express what he wants and just expects you to read his mind. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!

I understood best from reading the book. His class requires student-driven learning. His tests were really hard (even when he allowed notes) but he put a wicked curve on everyone\'s grades and I ended with an A in the class despite getting B- on the project and tests."

Hard to understand, not helpful, and his tests are ridiculous. When the max in the class is a 33/50 on an exam, the professor must be doing something wrong. Avoid."
