Beau  Roberts,Indian River State College,Biology department, Fort Pierce, FL,2,4.3,N/A,2.4,,8,10/27/2011,BSC2010,3.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Roberts is a really nice person, but as an instructor? Maybe not so much. He was helpful with how to conduct the experiment, but he never really went in depth on WHY the experiments were being done and what to look for while conducting them. His lab practicals were also tough, he would tell you what to study for and then change up on you."

He is honestly the best teacher I\'ve ever had because he knows how to make class entertaining while teaching the course to you better than anyone else can. I strongly recommend taking him, but just don\'t sit next to a fish tank because he will call you out if you look at the fish."

His a joy in class and makes you enjoy it! He lets us know exactly what to study before every test! You have to really pay attention to the lab assignments and go home and study the modules! VERY EASY! TAKE HIM if you want to learn and enjoy a class!"
