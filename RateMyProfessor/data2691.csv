I wish I had more time to spend asking him questions. He is very helpful and loves teaching. If only every professor I had could be so awesome. If you don\'t want to push yourself, he won\'t push you. But if you want to learn more, all you have to do is ask for his help, and he is more than willing to give it to you!"

He is very helpful, but kind of lazy and disorganized. I\'ve met students who know more than he does."

Like others said, he just reads the PowerPoints. Tests are free A\'s even if you skip every class. If you actually want to learn how to edit, get Nathan Snow as a lab instructor. He\'s extremely helpful and patient, too."

All tests but final is open notes. I did not show up to any class but the tests. Lectures are boring. He just reads from power points word for word. They are posted online. Had a great lab teacher who is really what taught the material for me.

All test are open note. I came into this class knowing nothing and right now the semester is almost over and I have an A. I barely went to Lecture only for tests. Easy teacher! Take him!"

Not at all inspirational or interesting. Not a difficult class, though."

That being said, his tests are dirt stupid and getting an A in his class is beyond easy. If you don\'t care about the subject and you want an easy A, go for it. Well... chances are you don\'t have the option if you\'re a Digital Media student at UCF, sorry."

That\'s really the only class you should take him for. Even still, he seems really uninterested in teaching. for DIG2500 lab, he didn\'t even do the lab activities our prof told him to do and he was exceedingly late or didn\'t show up without notice mult times. He\'s nice. 2030 tests are open notes (not exam)"

I\'ve walked out of this class countless times, it\'s depressing and annoying how elementary his lectures are, and add a heaping cup of unprofessionalism to that and you have a recipe for a terrible course."

He seems disinterested in the class and is incredibly vague about projects. One major problem is they DO NOT teach you Photoshop at all, if you don\'t know it at all find a friend and learn it. The labs are only for critiques, not for learning"

He is very knowledgeable in Final Cut for DIG 2030, but he seems not to care about Flash for DIG 2500 a whole lot and he appears not to know what is going on in the DIG 2500 course. So, I think he is only good for teaching video that is all."

He seems like a nice guy and is fairly knowledgeable about video and Final Cut, but he seems very disinterested in teaching and is somewhat unprofessional. I learned a few things, but this class (and every class in the DM department) could be so much better."
