She is very disrespectful to her students. She will not give you the time of day outside of class to raise any issues or concerns. She is very knowledgeable in the field, but is a very poor teacher. In fact, she comes ill prepared, and expects the students to do all the work. I believe she should be fired."

My best advice is not to take this class what so ever."

The one thing I disliked is that she has HER style and anyone who has a style which differs from hers will get a low grade. Her classes are interesting and she actually TEACHES. She comes on time and is a fair grader. Very good Professor.
