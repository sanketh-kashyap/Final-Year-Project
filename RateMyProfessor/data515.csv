Beware to check for negative and null values before process into algorithms in your hw. He is extremely helpful during office hours I encourage you to visit his office if you have questions.

The furthest left of any prof here, I think. The textbook is even further left, and not worth the $ (see reviews). Should count as writing intensive. If you can write, no problem getting an A.

He has high standards, but it always pays off to come to class and take notes. Extremely knowledgeable, yet down-to-earth and never makes you feel stupid. Don\'t take him for an easy A, but for actually learning stuff that will carry through to future classes, especially Java and C."
