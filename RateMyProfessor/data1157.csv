BEST CLASS EVER! Take good notes, because you\'ll want to remember what he says. Better yet, bring a digital recorder."

This was an optional module for me, and I am soooo glad I chose it. Zubin\'s full of energy and great examples...non stop talking for the entire class... but guess what, make sure you don\'t talk whilst he\'s talking!"

His lectures are not only interesting but invigorating. I always come away totally enthused. He has a passion for his subject, and a caring attitude towards his students. He always gives us loads of real life examples - many more than any text book would, and I think that has really helped my understanding. He\'s hot!"
