He will rarely answer any questions and if he does, he makes you feel like a complete idiot. Throws everything at you and expects you to figure it out on your own, horrible teaching methods. TA\'s were cool and helpful."

Intentionally tries to fail students. Dave expects that we know everything he knows and that we can read his mind; he treats us like we have been engineers for 20+ years, when it\'s our first engineering experience. Bad first impression if you ask me. And this is suppose to be an intro class... Worst ""teacher"" EVER."

Expects students to figure everything out themselves. His TAs are alright and the guy teaching actual machining is a good teacher.

Biggest problem is that he is very vague about expectations on assignments. It\'s hard to know what he wants unless you ask the right questions. Definitely seems to have favorites, so if you get on his good side you\'ll be alright."
