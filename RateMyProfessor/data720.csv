But from the 1st class, I knew that I wanted to keep taking the course. Angela is an amazingly caring instructor who goes out of her way to provide accommodations for her students. And the class itself is very interesting, definitely take it!"

Very disorganized, and not clear at all about class expectations. Could have been such a great class, but instead was my lowest priority for the quarter."

I would highly recommend GWSS 200 but NOT from her. I failed the midterm due to a miscommunication on which readings to write on."

She\'s unorganized, unhelpful, talks in circles but never actually explains anything & never replies to emails in a timely manner. There\'s no concrete grading system she uses, just on how much she likes you. DON\'T TAKE HER IF U HAVE A CHOICE!!!!!"

I am a GWSS major, clearly I have an interest inthe subject, but she turned a class that had such potential into an absolute waste of time. She has no tangible grading policies so it all comes down to favoritism and if you ever have an issue, she just gets defensive and refuses to help."

I am a women\'s studies major, but she is hard to understand and disorganized. The class is total joke as we never talk about the readings and she spends most of the time trying to make technology work."

Her discussions were free form.She is unorganized. She is unable to communicate clear instructions. Her midterms had too many questions w/out enough time to complete the test. Take another class from a more experienced prof!

I knew I should have dropped when it took her 30 minutes to take roll the first day. She assigns a****load of different work but is extremely unorganized and doesn\'t seem to understand her own expectations.

Yesterday she actually pulled out a nail file and used it while a student was talking.No lie.If you value your time, do not take this class."
