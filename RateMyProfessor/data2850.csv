However, if you actually value your education and put in the work and show up, this class is invaluable, no matter what degree you are seeking. Mr. Douglas is the MAN. Very into what he teaches, and very sarcastic, but he is a very respectable person."

If you bring up questions he\'s answered 10 times, He will smack you down with some of the best sarcasm there is. I might sound like I didn\'t like this professor, but he rocked. If you fail at least it was entertaining for you."

He may come off as harsh but he just really wants people in his class to act like adults as opposed to high school students. just try and you will do just fine.
