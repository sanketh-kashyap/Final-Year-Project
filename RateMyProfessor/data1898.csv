I find her to be one of the most unbiased open professors. She wants students to open their minds to seeing things in a different light and challenges students. She is a lovely person as well as a great teacher.

I would certainly take her again and recommend her to any serious students."

The thing I enjoy about her most is her way of teaching without interjecting personal opinion. She encourages class participation and is a great facilitator. I went into the class feeling confident that I was well versed in the subject matter, but I found that I learned more than I expected.TAKE HER CLASS!"
