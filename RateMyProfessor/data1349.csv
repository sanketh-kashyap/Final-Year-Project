Although I received an A, he made me re-do the semesters project one week before it was due. Take it if you into film but be ready to drop $. Oh and don\'t go to his movies presentation!"

He\'s really a sweetheart when he wants to be. Also, ALWAYS go to class, always bring something to do, and be prepared to spend endless amounts of money. Don\'t ever complain in his class. It really will benefit you, taking 12 rolls of film for one assignment, trust me. Ps: He winks ;)"

He also teaches grad students and expects the undergrads to be able to do the same. He insanely wants you to use at least 10 rolls of films on one project. Also, he played many black and white films in class which were not that bad"
