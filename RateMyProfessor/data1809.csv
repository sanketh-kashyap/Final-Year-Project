She made test outs sooooo laid back and doesn\'t make you feel like a nervous idiot like some profs in 320. She talks A LOT...sometimes it\'s hard to keep her focused but I just thought it was funny.

She is super supportive of her students and it\'s clear she loves to teach. She actively sought out clinical opportunities for us and was never condescending (as some clinical instructors can be). She made me fall in love with pediatrics!
