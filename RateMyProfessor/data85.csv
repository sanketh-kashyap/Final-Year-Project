Easy grading, very enthusiastic. If you want to learn a lot, you have to try and teach yourself the concepts. Or, you can leave the class with an A and not understand a thing about Probs and Stats. Antler is a great teacher if you want to learn."

Does not explain material. I have looked to youtube to learn the concepts. After looking on youtube I learned the that material is not very complicated. I would tell you not to take his class but he is the only one that teaches it.
