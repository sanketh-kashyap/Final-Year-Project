In the beginning of the semester I didnt like him because I felt that he didnt do anything like a professor should (give lectures, or study guide) but I\'ve come to realize he teaches by doing things with his students. he is a good prof"

Plenty off tedious assignments that are worth little points, so do them because they will add up. There arent alot of points in this class so make sure you give every assignment 100%"

Lectures are long, boring, and repetitive. He keeps you to the VERY end and sometimes goes over without a break. He assigns a LOT of busy work. Take with a different professor if you\'re not a KNES major."

Shared great ideas for teachers to bring into PE. He is kind, funny, and respectful to his students. Although his voice can be a little monotone, he tries really hard...and he\'s easy on the eyes ;)"

His lectures are boring and kinda irrelevant! Most of time spent learning in the gym playing the games. 2 exams and must create & teach 1 lesson plan. He\'s not real clear on the amount of points in class. Can get by without the book. His study guide is really helpful. Nice guy, that likes to have fun."

He is very cool and respectful. The class was EXTREMELY easy, there were only 2 midterms, 1 paper, 1 group presentation, and the final. Attendance is only mandatory in the 1st week and textbook use is very minimal. If you want an EASY A, TAKE HIM!!!"
