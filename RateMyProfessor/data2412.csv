She answers all questions in class and does not make anyone feel stupid for asking. She is helpful in LRC .

She has lots of stories, which can be a good thing. Unfortunately she makes it seem like she is talking down to students. Also, don\'t interrupt her with too many questions."

Clinical- a little harder. Just make sure you don\'t slack or she will hate you. As long as you do what you\'re supposed to be doing shes actually pretty friendly. A little abrasive if you mess up but always answers questions and helps you actually learn."

(which is what our pts expect too!) She could be abrasive, but I wouldn?t say that she was rude. Her teaching style (putting students on the spot) guarantees that each student will know that information for the rest of their career."

Learned a lot from her. Had her in clinical will never do it again. So hard in clinical setting. Grills you with questions. But if your not stupid you should be fine I was even though it was a nightmare.

(worse than Horning). Tells students they \'set themselves up for failure\' if they miss a class. She may have knowledge about nursing but i hope i never end up in a hospital and have her as my nurse b/c she is scary! I think she overuses her broom and may need a new one soon....

Make student cry. I don\'t know how she can even be a teacher. Her resume looks impressive but does not reflect in her attitude. She is really something else.
