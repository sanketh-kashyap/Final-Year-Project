The textbook is helpful and the homework assignment and quizzes are similar. There are weekly quizzes and homework assignments, but they are short and easy if you study the lecture notes and the short readings."

He helps you learn the language in a very non-overwhelming way. Never condescending or annoyed. I learned a lot in one semester! Really enjoyed this class and would recommend to anyone not wanting to take traditional romantic languages.

He is funny, helpful, hospitable, and his personality is absolutely magnetic. I only planned on taking 1 semester, and I ended up taking 4! I studied in East Africa and thanks to Mwalium I was very well-equipped!"
