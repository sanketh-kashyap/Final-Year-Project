Very knowledgeable, gives great feedback, and makes you work hard! Generates important discussions during class, invites interesting artists to present their work for students, shows great samples of video art. Adds great workshops: montage theory, distribution, light. Other profs loose in comparison."

He is very open on every subject and is very accessible. I liked to study in his class.

However Nelson lacks the fundamental qualities a teacher should have, he clearly does not enjoy vomiting up the same thing he has been teaching for years, you can tell by his half closed eyes and meandering lazy voice."

On his good days however, he was very critical and constructive and served as good guidance. He can be harsh at times but that\'s only if you\'re too sensitive. He\'s a great teacher to have especially because he still practices."

Sometimes it appeared like he didn\'t want to teach, or he was being lazy. Writing assignments were even worse & useless. To put it: mediocre."
