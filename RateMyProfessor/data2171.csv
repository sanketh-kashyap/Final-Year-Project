TOUGH GRADER,2,0,"I took Fitch many years ago & thought all these comments were hilarious and accurate This man prepped me for medicine..I\'m just finishing my didactic year in the Physician Assistant program & his class was harder than some I am taking now. If you want to KNOW, and I mean REALLY know the stuff, take him. If you\'re trying to get a free ride, don\'t."

VERBATIM. And he is serious. Treats every student like they are all going into nursing school so tries to make it comparable. If u are nursing, great--but some aren\'t. By far the hardest class I\'ve ever had, learned a lot tho."

No. His lectures are FASCINATING but they rarely pertain to the what we need to know. Lecture tests are VERY hard. Doesn\'t tell you what to know for tests, which is stressful for labs. Gives pop quizzes the day after starting new material. Have perfect attendance if you want a shot at xtra credit"

Tells you how to make and maintain an ""A"" if you don\'t put the effort in you will fail, 3 to 4 hours every day for study time. Can\'t wait for his A&P II class"

If you need explanation of how things work, then find another professor. He is ontime and always lets class out on time. Bottom Line HARD HARD HARD. Atleast 3 or more hours a night in studying"
