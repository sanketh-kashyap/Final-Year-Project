I have always liked math, but he makes the class fun with his silly humor! He explains step by step how to solve problems. He also walks around asking if anyone needs help, which I appreciate. I was hoping to have him for Math 94, however he isn\'t teaching that class this year. :( We need more teachers like him!!"

Ahlvin made me confident & understand math. His humor is an bonus amenity. He does give generous homework daily, except for after test. I wanted to take him for 94 unfortunately he didn\'t teach now I\'m averaging a D. The professor definitely makes a difference."

I abhor math class, but I could actually stand his and passed it no problem. He doesn\'t use Math XL, which I actually liked about him.
