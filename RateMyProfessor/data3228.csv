She is not an ""easy"" A, she is just very generous in the way she grades her tests and projects. There was a group project where two members did nothing at all and got full credit, choose your teammates carefully!!!"

As long as you turn in all work and take notes you should be good. one tip, at the end of the semester make sure you check that she put in all the grades correctly for your assignments. I turned in everything except for one assignment and in all assignments I got perfect scores but she gave a ""C""."
