I thought she was very knowledgeable and enjoyed class discussions. Make sure to read because we had pop quizzes on the h.w. Used all books, so make sure to buy them. Wrote all essays, no tests. B+ in both classes"

However she is a terrible public speaker, making her lectures difficult to follow. DON\'T copy her lecture notes, they look like reminder notes to herself. Also seems to think that anybody conservative is a **** or being manipulated by ****s."

She is the most helpful professor at BU, she answers e-mails within an hour! Lectures engaging, clear, useful assignments. You will learn so much from attending class and discussion. Average amount of reading, uses all books she requires students to buy. Will miss her class very much!"

She\'s usually pretty clear, but her notes are just lines of text sprinkled randomly onto a slide with a photo or two--very little form. Does not like conservatives."

Very clear, lectures are engaging and notes are helpful. Heavy focus on writing. Discussion and lecture attendance are necessary to pass this class."

Easy tests but there are only two of them with TAs making up the rest with papers. She is a great prof.

You should probably already like history, and plan on attending class because all the notes are in class and really are necessary when writing the essays."
