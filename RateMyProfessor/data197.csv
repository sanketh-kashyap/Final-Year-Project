She WILL get you to participate. There is NO being quiet in her class! The textbook and workbook are major parts of the course. The tests are just like to reviews so study those and you shall receive a good grade.

But she gets to know her students very well and truly teaches teach the language. Her class is a tough class because she doesn\'t take laziness or lack of trying. She really believes her students can do well. She gives quite a few exams but if you attend class you\'ll do fine. Fun oral exam.
