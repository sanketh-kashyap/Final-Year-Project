She was one of the most realistic teachers I\'ve had!She was always helpful, responded to my emails promptly and stayed as late as I needed her to after class to help. She is practically the only teacher I know that believes if we fail her class she failed us. Im going to really miss her class."

She was nice and always got back to me within 24 hours. The class was very easy to follow. Many students would ask a ton of questions the day before the assignment was due- it\'s not the teacher\'s fault they waited until the last second to start their course work. I would recommend taking her.

She doesnt help, gets mad when we ask questions, and doesnt grade our work. She takes over three weeks to grade on an 8 week course."

She posts things that have errors or have conflicting information. She blames the class, and yet she isnt there to help us. I have never been so frustrated with ANY instructor, and never have had any kind of problems like this with any class. The entire class is confused. She says SHE is frustrated! Yeah."

We had to do reports each week that were 2-3 pages. But because she is not clear she\'d have us do our report on one thing and (never told us students) to include textbook references. So of course the first week everyone failed and she blamed the students. Hm, if everyone fails. I kind of think that it\'s a sign that you\'re an idiot?"
