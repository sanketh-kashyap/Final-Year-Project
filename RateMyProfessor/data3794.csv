She is funny and makes the text easy to understand. Kelly Mzik has been one of my favorite professors at Dixie. If you read the chapters and show up for class you will get an A. The test are not hard at all! The ""final"" was one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in class."

The class is very challenging and she makes it crystal clear to understand. I love the open forum atmosphere of her class where everyone is able to give their opinions and views without being criticized. I strongly recommend her!
