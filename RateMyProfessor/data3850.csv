Her assignments were inexplicit , questions were answered with criptic messages or not at all. She acted like she did not want to be there. No examples or class expectations provided. I hope I NEVER have to take a class from this instructor again"

Relevant assignments with options that are suitable to a variety of interests and abilities. Monitors boards and replies quickly to questions/comments. Grading is very picky as she notes particulars that may not have been specified in assignment description. More feedback would have been nice.
