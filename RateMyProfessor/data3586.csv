He was very helpful, but he just doesn\'t have the knack for teaching. We went from a full class, to approx. 9 students left at the end of the semester. We all struggled right up to the end. Nice guy, bad teacher. Also, he was VERY disorganized. You never knew what or when something was expected from you."

He is also very disorganized. Try to get on his good side, as he does play favorites. In my opinion, he shouldn\'t be a teacher. The final review was worthless because a lot of things on the test were not on the review. Do not take him! I gained no knowledge from this class!"

He understood Chemistry perfectly but had no idea how to teach it. Anyone who had a question in class was made to look like a fool, he laughed at the questions. THIS WAS AN INTRO CLASS!! And he definitely was one to play favorites. Save yourself the hassel and do not take this class!"

Tests are HARD and sometimes can be confusing. Overall, I would take him again!"

He doesnt explain things enough. puts things on tests he doesnt go over. no study guides. in his intro to chem class its like a chem 3 class. i hated going and so did the people in his class i talked too.

The class started with 31 kids, and ended with 11. Starts off easy, but its real hard bc he doesnt know how to teach the material. GET OUT if u can"
