Test are difficult, and hard to study for because often the questions will not be similar to those on the practice exams, but instead much harder. ALWAYS favors international students!"

At times her accent is a minor determent, but it is easily overcome, as she makes her point very clear through the use of extensive notes on the board. Very good instructor."

Problem is, she\'s not always the best at explaining things. A decent instructor, but you might want to find someone different if math isn\'t your strong suit."

You can easily understand Alice if you just listen. I flunked 107 with a horrible TA but took it with Alice the next semester and everything clicked.

Therefore she talks like, i have no problem with that its just hard to concentrate on her. The clarity of explaining is tough to understand, I recommend finding a different TA for math"
