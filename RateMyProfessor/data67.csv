The instructor really tried but what he taught and what was on the test was VERY different. Also gave us study material for final which ended up being entirely different. I feel like I wasted my time. If you don\'t have good grasp on the material you will spend hours at the tutor.!

Class avg 70, spent most of my time at the tutor relearning all sections, but he did try. Learned more at the tutor than in this class, take at a com college if you can."
