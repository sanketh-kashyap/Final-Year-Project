She is a no-nonsense down-to-business instructor, and I like that. She grades homework and tests right away, and is more than willing to help when you have questions. I wish more instructors were like her. Be sure to take advantage of the tutoring hours before class too, as this helps for exams."

All the material is made up by the State so can\'t really blame her for the tests or anything. She tries to make it as fun as possible. You HAVE to show up for class and do fairly well on chapter tests. But again these are the states standards for Nursing Assistants not hers. She was awesome though.
