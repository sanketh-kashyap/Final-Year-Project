You do have to do performance reports and a few take home test and there is a listening test also which are fairly easy. I had so much fun in this course."

She made the material flow nicely and kept it simple. Tests were not difficult, the reviews were very helpful. Plenty of note taking, but the class is a breeze as long as you pay attention. Good professor I highly recommend taking her class."
