When she graded and commented on my assessments, I missed a few points. Just make sure you include every possible answer in the assessment. Then you won\'t potentially miss points. She gets back quickly, and there are no exams. I enjoyed her class a lot!"

I have taken 3 different Art History courses from her online and loved each of them. She keeps information current. The online course requires quite a bit of time, but once you get used to the schedule it goes smoothly. She is very fair at grading and gives great feedback."
