They only qualms I had was with how the test were structured, its all essay!! Which can be difficult at times but she gives you a review sheet to study from, so that helps. She is very helpful and gives great feedback. She really is a awesome person."

She is the hardest professor I had in my School of Continuing Studies program. She is also the best. I learned more from her than I did most of the professors at CHC. Pay attention and do the work- and you are guaranteed to learn.

She is a very fair and clear. She can relate the topic to you in everyday realistic terms. She asks that you write a weekly paragraph about what is going on in the world around you. She gives a review sheet so you will know exactly what to study. I got A\'s in both of her classes.
