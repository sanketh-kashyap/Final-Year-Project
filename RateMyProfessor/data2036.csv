She is very negative and will discourage you from learning. Instead of teaching, she is more focused on being a dictator. I pity the fool that has to take her class. Steer clear, very clear. She has zero passion for teaching. She\'s hell on earth - words cannot explain. x_x"

She has high expectations for her students, but wants you to succeed and cares deeply about each student. I am now a news producer and I apply the skills she taught me in Rockbridge Report every single day at work. Excellent, smart and caring professor."

A print journalism major, I needed to learn the broadcast skills to supplement my knowledge. What I learned in her classroom is vital to my day-to-day work now. A tough grader with high expectations for her students. But she teaches you the skills/integrity you need to succeed in a journalism career."

Yes, she is demanding and yes, she is not one to coddle but let\'s be honest: that\'s the reality of a real-life broadcast newsroom. If you put in the effort, she\'ll reward you with a rich understanding of journalism and an invested interest in seeing you succeed."

I stopped asking questions after she took off points on assignments based on those questions, and rather just hoped she wouldn\'t notice I hadn\'t known! She rarely did. Her anxiety is unbearable and contagious. I know I\'ll have a bad boss in the jworld, but don\'t need her now"

I seriously considered not becoming a Journalism major because of this class, mostly because of her. I would steer clear of her as much as possible."

Sadly, it\'s impossible not to be pejorative in warning would-be majors how offensive, objective, anxious, childish and cantankerous she is. Will ruin your term."

While Professor Somani has somewhat improved the Reid Hall program, her social awkwardness and inability to control her anxiety level leads to classroom disasters, especially during the weekly Thursday news show."

A fair grader overall, but very tough. She has an anxiety level that\'s contagious, but so long as you keep things in perspective you should be alright."

She could have done a lot more with the class because it\'s her specialty. I didn\'t learn anything. She forced us to watch her documentary and to write a response on it. She is not at all objective and unfair.
