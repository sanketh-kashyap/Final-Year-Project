She is the one that inspired me to take cadaver lab, and that experience made me more passionate about anatomy. One of the funniest teachers I\'ve ever had. It\'s good to stay positive in this very hard class. She is very considerate and supportive. Gotta put in the work, but it\'s so worth it!"

Im actually quite upset that I will not have her for AP 103. I was never bored in her class. She keeps you on your toes (In a good way!)You definitely have to put time and effort aside to study for her quizes and tests, but it\'s Anatomy, so thats a given!"

She always makes time for her students and answers any questions. She is also extremely smart and very fun. I would of left GRCC if I didn\'t have her this quarter. She bends over backwards for her students. If you have a hard time, let her know and she will work with you.She is kinda silly, but just roll with it ;P"

If you have any question, just talk to her because she will give you a hand. if you think your quiz get more points, talk to her too. because she may give you some points back."
