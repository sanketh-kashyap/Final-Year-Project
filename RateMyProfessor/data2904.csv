If your goal is to know the subject, take her classes. The course is kind of difficult and covers a lot of material, but she makes it easy to understand."

She is a wonderful instructor that will go out of her way for anyone, if they ask her for it! She goes above and beyond the normal instructor. Anatomy is a rough course to take, so nobody can expect it will be a breeze."

Got A\'s in all my other Bio classes, love the subject. I hated every minute of this term with her. She makes no sense, has no idea what she is doing. I dont feel she even knows the material that she is trying to teach. Her tests were not written well, it was hard to userstand what she was even asking for. I do not recommend!!!"
