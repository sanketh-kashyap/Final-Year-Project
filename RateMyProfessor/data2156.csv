Richard  Dziekan,Montgomery County Community College (all),Computer Information Systems department, Blue Bell, PA,0,4.5,N/A,2.0,,1,02/02/2009,CIS110,4.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Mr. Dziekan is a very nice guy who was unlucky enough to get stuck teaching a very boring class when I had him. It was a basic computer class and even though he tried to keep it fun, it was just easy and boring. He was always willing to help with problems and was just very pleasant and easy going."
