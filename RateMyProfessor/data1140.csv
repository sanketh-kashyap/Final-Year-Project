Very lecture heavy and gives out a ton of papers. His instructions for assignments are NEVER clear and his syllabus isn\'t accurate either regarding when things are due. How he explains things & his train of thought are so beyond weird that I could never in attention in lecture

He gives out lots of papers to write and he is very lecture heavy. If you go to class everyday, you\'ll do fine on the tests. His study guides are really really really long but totally unnecessary. If you listen well and do the assignments and read occasionaly, you\'ll do fine on tests."

He will waste hours of your life every week and will talk himself to death during his painful lectures.

If you take the time to talk with him he is very nice, and always willing to help you succeed in his class. He is a very good grader, but perhaps not the best speaker.

Get\'s major assignments back to you in about a month or two. He knows his stuff, just struggles while speaking in front of an audience. Boring but not bad."
