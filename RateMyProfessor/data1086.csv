It takes a while to get over the accent, but if you?re observant enough you?ll realize he?s actually a rather intellectual guy at heart. There is a mid-term and a final, both have multiple choice and essay questions. He gives out a study guide beforehand, and the questions are nearly identical, so don?t study too hard. Good luck!"

He doesn\'t let you stress out. He gives out an identical practice test to take home and study which is very helpful because his lectures consist of sentences that don\'t really make sense. He\'ll also pick on you to read.
