Camerino  Sanchez,Santa Barbara City College,Criminal Justice department, Santa Barbara, CA,0,4.5,N/A,3.0,,1,09/06/2010,AJ101,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,He\'s such a great Professor! He is the Chief of Police in SB and he has tons of stories that are related to what we learn. It was really helpful to have that advantage when learning. He\'s not intimidating which is what I thought it would be like but he\'s super relaxed. Attendance is nessicary beacause of the quizzes.
