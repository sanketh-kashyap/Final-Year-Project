Prof doesn\'t answer emails though- so if you have a question just ask after class."

Midterm and Final were multiple choice- and not very clear. Research paper was a drag. Make sure you turn in the ""rough draft"" and you should do fine. Unlike previous reviewer, there was a 60% on the paper but most students got a B or C on it. He grades on a curve overall. Attend lectures and you\'ll get an A."

Also regardless how close you are to the next grade level he doesn\'t round up. For instance 89.5% is not an A. The papers he assigns is rediculious but I\'d suggest making sure to right it like any research paper, no one got better than about a 60% on it."
