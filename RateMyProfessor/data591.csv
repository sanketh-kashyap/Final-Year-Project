He is a cool old guy but gets off topic sometimes. We watched a few videos every now and then in class. I wouldn\'t recommend taking this class in the early morning but overall if you show up its an easy class to pass

Allows students to distract him from is lecture. Major pushover when it comes to assignments. 3/4- 1/2 of our class never came except for test days. I dont think I learned anything new in his class. I spend so much money on books and he never even had us open them, when he said they were mandatory."

He has no business being in a classroom. Sweet guy, but a total pushover, gets off topic a LOT, and was very unclear about his expectations and his criteria changed constantly. Didn\'t get the real syllabus til 3 weeks into class."
