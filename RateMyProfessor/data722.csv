Karen  Madded,Macomb Community College (all campuses),Health Science department, Macomb, MI,0,5.0,N/A,5.0,,1,01/30/2010,HT1700,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,she teaches Medical terminalogy and is an excellent teacher. The class is easy but a lot of memorization. She makes the class fun. Her exams are easy and always with extra credit. Can\'t imagine how anyone can possible fail or get a back grade in her class.
