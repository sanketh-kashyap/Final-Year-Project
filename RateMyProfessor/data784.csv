He gives all the answers to the hw problems, and you can take as many notes as you want during the exams. Let me say that again, as many as you want! I\'m sure you can see the potential in this."

He is unclear and his tests are SOOO hard! more than 50% has a failing grade now! DONT TAKE HIM!!!"

He is always late and disorganized, the first day of class he didn\'t show up until 20 mins after the class was supposed to start. His notes are almost impossible to follow and he often stands directly in front of the board so you are constantly having to catch up when he moves. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHERS CLASS!!"
