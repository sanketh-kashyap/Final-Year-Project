He talks about his FT article for 80% of the class and then about the book. He makes students useless. You are never right when participating so you are better off not participating at all. you can learn everything from class by just watching msnbc. I would not recommend this prof.

Anyone can teach from a textbook, but few people have his range of information and experience. He expects you to show up and participate, but the effort is well worth it."
