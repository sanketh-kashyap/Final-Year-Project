She is especially caring, nice and makes class easygoing/relaxed. The class is not very demanding, it\'s how a core curriculum class should be! Even two years after her class, she still recognizes me on campus and is always friendly and smiles. Calls her students ""darling"" and ""angel"" like a grandma."
