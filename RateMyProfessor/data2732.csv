Knows his material well. Excellent at explaining what is meant to be taught. You have to attend class as well as read the text to fully understand. Fair exam. I would recommend this prof to everyone.

It\'s like there were things on the exam we didn\'t cover in class. Does NOT provide enough homework problems to cover the material taught in class. I think he\'s a swell guy, it might just be the material he\'s teaching. Just a terrible experience."
