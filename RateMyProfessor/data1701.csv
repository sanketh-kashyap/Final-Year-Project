Jorge  Perez,University of Kansas,Spanish & Portuguese department, Lawrence, KS,5,4.9,N/A,3.3,,11,03/13/2014,SPAN453,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I absolutely LOVED this class. Jorge makes class fun and he is rather comical. His outfits are always on point and his teaching is even more awesome. Expect to learn a lot and to fall in love again with the Spanish language and film as taught by Jorge. I recommend this class to all of my friends in the Spanish department. 10/10 would take again.

Class is just going over a sheet of paper with questions about the readings, and those questions are basically your study guide for the tests."

You can get on his good side particularly if you\'re already familiar with accents & if you know anything about feminism or strong female figures from Spanish history. He\'s very engaging & full of jokes. Seems intimidating at first, but is actually very friendly and helpful."

He grades pretty hard, but he\'s fair and consistent. His lectures and class discussions are generally something to look forward to. He has the important attribute of being very knowledgeable about Spanish culture, as he is from Spain. NOTE: He loves to take off points for gender/number agreement errors."

Take especially if you want exposure to the Spain side of the equation. Balances text with his own lectures and important little tidbits you won\'t get from anybody but a native speaker. Highly recommend.

He\'s smart, funny and cares about what you take from the class. In-class discussions in all 3 classes I\'ve tken from him were fascinating and enjoyable. He\'ll provide plenty of help outside class, provided you demonstrate you take his class seriously. Wears loafers."

He is intelligent, moves very fast, but you will learn more than you have in any Spanish class up til now."
