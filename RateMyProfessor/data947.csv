He never answers questions thoroughly and isn\'t pleasant to be around. You have an opportunity to do 5 tests (one is dropped) and 3 out of 5 papers (one is dropped). The tests are worded to fool you and he grades the papers extremely hard. Read the books thoroughly and be specific when writing papers.
