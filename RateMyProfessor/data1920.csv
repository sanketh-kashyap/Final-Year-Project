Katherine  Amerson,University of South Carolina Upstate,Communication department, Spartanburg, SC,0,2.0,N/A,4.0,,1,02/01/2009,SJOU305,2.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"RUN AWAY!!! I took Amerson for Newswriting/Reporting, she does not explain how to write news stories and she does not give you a chance explore and learn in the classroom. NO SECOND CHANCES to IMPROVE. Horrible teacher, she shows favorites, she quizzes almost every day, all I can say is study hard and be prepared, you will struggle."
