Chiara  Ruffa,University of Victoria,Political Science department, Victoria, BC,0,4.0,N/A,2.4,,5,08/05/2009,POLI348,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"This term, she has been using reserve or online readings. She always asks if everything was clear in class and will explain every point to the point of satisfaction despite her light Italian accent. She is very friendly and goes above and beyond her duty to make sure that she is available to her students."

The text was difficult but if you went to the effort to ask for help Chiara would bend over backwards to clarify. Doing the readings and grammatically well papers guaranteed a high mark.

She is a very fair marker and is very clear in her lecture notes. I found her to be a very intelligent and a nice person. I would def recommend Poli Sci 348 to be taken with Chiara!

Really helpful and approachable in class and outside of class. If you put in the effort she\'ll make it worthwhile.
