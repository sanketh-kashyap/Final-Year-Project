The readings, screenings, and paper topics are interesting and good for both RHCS-majors and gen electives. Class is heavily discussion based, with her serving as a moderator/agenda setter, which occasionally gets repetitive. Not hard to succeed, but put in the work and you will learn as well."

It was a very interesting class. She is somewhat of a tough grader, but she provides great feedback and always welcomes you to her office. She gives 11 reading quizzes, but you are allowed to drop your lowest grade. There are no tests in the class and the longest paper is 4-5 pages."

She is awesome and so interesting!! Hope i can take her again."

She revamped her course and now just arbitrarily gives out grades. The discussions are very circuitous and boring...difficult to stay awake. Pop quizzes once a week, one paper, blog posts throughout the semester, a midterm, and a cumulative final."

She\'s a nice person and seems to want everyone to do well. THe material is boring as ****, but she manages to liven it up w random youtube clips and whatnot. Sometimes her test questions were VERY ambiguous/not well phrased, which def cost people in my class points. Overall pretty decent teacher."

She\'s fresh out of grad school and at some times was completely overmatched by intelligent students who don\'t agree with her. Her tests were confusing and she often made mistakes on them. Also she\'s very liberal and if you aren\'t completely to the left, make sure to censor your opinions."

She also uses clips from SNL and the Daily Show."
