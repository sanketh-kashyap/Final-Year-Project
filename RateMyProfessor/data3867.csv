The latter was one of the best learning experiences of my life. It\'s a fair amount of work, but I felt extremely rewarded for my effort. He\'s very willing to help, too, and extremely enthusiastic about teaching."

He helped me with paper issues and was always willing to talk about any concerns I had in or outside of class. His humor made class enjoyable, even at 10am. :)"

He is stubborn, so if you\'re opinionated expect to butt heads with him, but he\'s willing to listen if you can explain yourself intelligently. His field trips are awesome too! The only good thing about Sweet Briar, in my opinion, and best English professor I\'ve ever had."

He cares about his students and has brilliant insight into the courses he takes. He encourages his students to think outside of the box and question their own beliefs. You MUST take a course with him before you graduate!
