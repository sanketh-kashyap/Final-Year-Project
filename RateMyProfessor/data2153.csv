She gives notes to print out on titanium(print them out!). There is a test every other Tuesday and no test on weeks with exams.

Throughout the semester i got an A. Finals were a bit harsh and ended up with a B+ overall. NO TEXTBOOK. All homework is online, very tedious and has nothing to do with tests or finals. Her study guides she posted helps a lot, finals is half of it."

You pretty much have to have an IQ lower than 100 In order to fail. She explains every step as she\'s doing examples. Writing project was easy, just be careful who you pick. Before tests she gives you a review sheet, which are really helpful, & posts solutions online. I really wish she taught math 150B, save your notes!"

This was a math 40 (remedial class) and i have no idea what she was talking about during the entire semester. I hate math and i felt like she didnt take the time to fully explain everything.
