Knows her stuff but can\'t teach to save her life. Should stick to just being a practicing audiologist. Sent out speaking notes for us to interpret and never discussed content. Maybe taught a total of 4 things during class time. Wasted what class time we did have. Interesting subject but worst professor ever! :(
