Had to teach myself everything out of the textbook. The man also has the most useless PowerPoints ever. Be warned, he will quiz on advanced biochemical theories he may mention in passing in class"

Attend lecture, PAY ATTENTION, take good notes, study from old exams, and you should be fine! REALLY FUNNY GUY! I hated him at first, but I grew to like him. I bombed the first test, averaged two tests, got 100% on one test, and got an A in the class."

Doing practice problems and such will not help you, but grasping the main concepts are what you will be tested on."

Tests alternate between super easy and super hard, at least when I took the class."
