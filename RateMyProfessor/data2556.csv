Eric  Shea-Brown,University of Washington,Mathematics department, Seattle, WA,9,2.6,N/A,2.8,LECTURE HEAVY (1),15,03/05/2018,AMATH342,5.0,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,Yes,N/A,,0,0,"Eric is a swell guy. There is not much work for this course, a homework every 2 weeks or so. They can be time consuming and you have to do the reading but they are graded generously. Only downside of this course was that it was 2.5 hours once a week, would prefer the time to be split up."

This course was designed to be an into course for anyone who had no coding or neural knowledge. It was far from that. All of the materials were given at the end of class. The lectures only cover a fragment of what you need to do with the homework You know it\'s bad when google can\'t help you.

There is no syllabus, discussion board, online grade book, homework feedback, or any form of organization to this class. The homework is not posted online and the TA\'s do not have access to the homework unless you show them the copy you got in class."

Never take his class.He never respond to e-mail. very hard to be in touch with him. I think his T.A. are way better than him. I am surprised such a agood institution have him as a professor. Woa

For students who need extra help on hw, the help was not prompt, presentations and handwrittn notes were too messy."

I don\'t think he cares how much you have learned, just wants to get paid. I wonder how long he has been hiding here at the UW. Jobs are shrinking at this time; kick him out of here."

After he teaches us something, he goes \'okay who cares\', \'whatever\', or \'doesn\'t matter\'. He\'s just always saying something strange and comical. Seriously though, he seems to genuinely care about student questions and concerns."

According to Shea-Brown, everything is ""good enough"" even when the class is staring at disbelief at multitudes of variables intermixed in incomprehensible formulas. Gotta love the tight ponytail though! He likes to stand on chairs."

Not a clear lecturer. Attending lecture is not helpful for homework yet is the only way to learn byhand methods for tests. Brutal"
