She offered on campus tutoring every week. Pay attention, ask questions, participate. I ended up enjoying this class very much."

She is not clear when talking about the readings, instead she rambles on and asks you to discuss. Tests are very difficult and confusing, what she points on them she barely talks about in class and expects you to know about it yet this this a beginner course. never take her!! she cant teach"

She does basically nothing to help you improve your grade. Her quizes are only 6-10 questions so they weight a lot on your grade. The tests are only like 20 questions so you are basically screwed if you get even a couple wrong! I knew nothing about Philosophy and I still dont.

The BIG chunk of your grade is the paper! make a ""A"" or ""B"" on the paper and make a C or better on the final and you\'ll pass for sure! I received a B in the course.Good Luck !!"

The absolute worst. It\'s the end of the semester and I can only give you the gist of any philosophical readings. She tries to cover waaaaaaay too many materials, and makes an intro class way more confusing than it needs to be. NEVER take a class with her."

Her knowledge of philosophy is limited to post Kantian Logistics, with a fairly average understanding of Classic Philosophy. Unfortunately she is unable to teach in any manner I would find appropriate at the university level. Overall she is not a capable instructor,"

Very unclear in her explanations and rambles way too much. She doesn\'t inform the students of the magnitude of assignments and focuses too much on the little ones. tries to cover way too much material for the time we have. writes super confusing tests. don\'t take her."

Attendence isn\'t mandatory but she does give quizes in class. She isn\'t terribly difficult or aweful...just not a good professor.

I\'m not much of a Philosophy person, but having her didn\'t help. Her into class is way too difficult and she tries to cover too many topics in too little time. She is nice and is very passionate about Philosophy and that\'s all I ca say good about her and the class."

Is she going to hold your hand like HS teachers? No. However if you take the time to study you will do well. I had ZERO interest in Philosophy before this class & now I love it. I got an A and I\'m an average student."

She truly makes her Philosophy introductory course way harder than it should be. Her availability is also not so great.

I sit in the front row and I have trouble hearing her and her lectures dont really help with the test, it\'s basically all from the text book."

She certainly has never read the philosophy department Mission statement. She should NOT be representing SHSU as faculty. I can\'t believe she gets paid for victimizing SHSU students!!

Her papers do require that you truly think about the subject, but not that bad. Her tests are straight out of the book. Read and understand and you will do fine."

Even after taking really in-depth notes, the tests are hard. The final paper is ridiculous and her grading system for it makes no sense."

She teaches this introductory course as if it were an upper level philosophy class. Sometimes she does not even have a lecture ready. She takes roll every day and her tests are hard even if you really study. Don\'t recommend taking this professor.
