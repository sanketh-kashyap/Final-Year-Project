Perella  Rooz,Touro College,Psychology department, Brooklyn, NY,6,3.5,N/A,2.4,Tough Grader (1),13,11/15/2015,PSY101,1.0,4.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,TOUGH GRADER,0,2,She clearly she went to Touro for her graduate/doctorate degree- she does not know her subject matter at all. I think I could have explained the material better. She is a harsh grader and does not give any feedback as to why she took off the points. Touro needs to really look into who they hired- she sucks.

She teaches experimental psychology with a PsyD, little background in research methods. She can be nasty and obnoxious when it comes to communication with her students. She does not explain criteria for grading. You will leave this class confused. Do not take her if you can avoid it!"

She is a great professor. She brings in a lot of examples from her work, her class has a relaxed atmosphere to it. She is hard though. You need to know the material. Her first test was killer. But if you work hard, you can definitely get the grade."
