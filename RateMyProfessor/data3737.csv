I was never interested in art, and after this class.. let\'s just say I have a new hobby. She is fun and energetic, you will never be bored in her class. I am not an art-sy person and I ended up getting an A because she just wants you to really try do the projects and always be there. Oh, and we didn\'t use a book!"
