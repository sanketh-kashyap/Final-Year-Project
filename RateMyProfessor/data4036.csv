Marshall F.  Klaus,SUNY Plattsburgh,Environmental Science department, Plattsburgh, NY,0,3.0,N/A,4.3,,3,05/16/2009,ENV101,3.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"This class was hard for me. But Marshall is very helpful. He gives you packets of the notes and there are about 12 quizzes, 2 papers, and a project ( besides the midterm & final)."

He gives you a packet on all the stuff he wants you to know and goes over it in class. The class mostly consisted of quizzes, 1 easy project,2(1&1/2 pg) papers, a midterm, and final. The class can get really boring but overall not so bad."

He just throws information at you during class without enough explaination and assumes that the class has plenty of prior knowledge on the subject. EXTREMELY BORING TOO!
