Didnt go to class that much and recieved an A. 3 test and 4 essays. Got the book but didnt look at it at all! Memorize study guide and recieve A on test. Easy!

He\'s energetic and makes learning easy and interesting. Time flew by in his classes. He wants everyone to pass and provides students with everything they need to do so. There were 4 papers and three tests. He gave us study groups and study guides for the tests so we were fully prepared.

Yet, Prof. Levy expects you to learn the information and use it in the classes three papers and three test. All in all I enjoyed this class."

No other class has my attention like he does. I want to continue to take more of his courses. However doesnt go to my degree, was fun. ciao"

Just show up and do the work and you\'ll receive an A. There\'s only 3 tests in the entire semester and he prints a study guide for each one. I highly recommend this teacher and class for anyone interested in psychology."

He doesn\'t overload you with work which allows breathing room for your other classes. I\'d probably take another one of his classes because I did get some valuable info that actually stuck.

Other than a few students who kept interrupting him, I enjoyed his class! He has the students write four essays and take three tests. The tests pull questions directly from the study guide so you know what will be on them. Highly recommend taking his class!"

He is very smart and kept me engaged in the topics. If you do the work to the best of your ability then you should get an A. The subject were interesting, the papers were pretty cool topics and the tests weren\'t 2 hard as long as you did the study guide and studied it. I wish he taught more classes!"

He rambles on about topics that aren\'t relivent to the class. For example, he talked about how to do a reference section for 45 minutes! Something that should of been covered in English 111. I\'m sorry, but I like structure in class. I like learning about the subject I\'m paying for."
