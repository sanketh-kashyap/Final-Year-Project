Her coursework is not an easy ""A"" because there\'s a lot of critical thinking involved. I enjoy her intellectual discussions and interesting dialogues."

As a result, the questions were random, so you can\'t predict what would be on the next exam. Boring lecture. provided the slides (with blanks to fill in during the lecture) the 2nd half of the class because everybody asked for them. NOT recommended!"

She does not provide any notes and speaks to fast to keep up. She does not provide study guides, reviews or even breaks during class. Do not take her."
