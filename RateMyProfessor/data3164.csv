Tries to dock students as much as possible for the littlest things in essays. Rambles on. Most classes are monotonus and not worth going to. Take someone else if you can!

The majority of his presentations are him rambling on and on.....on and on....and on and I mean on! We hardly ever learn anything interesting. The class is called ""Restoration of the Pacific Northwest"" but shold really be called ""Naptime"" in my opinion."
