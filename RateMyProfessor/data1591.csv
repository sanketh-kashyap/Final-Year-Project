Such an intelligent individual and YES, shes so pretty. Unfortunately shes only a TA for Chem recitation but I LUCKILY got her two times in a row for Chem 1 and 2!! She knows her stuff and can teach. Goes over material before giving us the quiz. Gave me a 105 for Chem 1 recitation which really helped me get my A. :D"

Reviews everything in detail,explaining all the information needed for the quiz that occurs shortly after. This should be the recitation session that brings up any bad chem grades. Easy 100+ grade with bonus points. If you are on top of gen chem 1031 and study lightly, you will find every quiz to be cake."
