Very passionate about the topic, and very knowledgeable. You HAVE to read and be prepared to discuss the books, but she is very open to multiple interpretations and ideas. Tough grader but an A is very possible if you do your reading and put the time in."

She is fair in grading and all she really asks is that you read the assigned material for each class so that she can hold a discussion with everyone. Plus, she is super funny and entertaining to listen to. She obviously enjoys the material and her job. Oh, and her physical appearance is pretty wild! Take her!"

She\'s open to all opinions as long as you can back them up. She promotes individual and critical thinking, and because of this, she got me interested in literature (unlike my high school lit teachers). You\'d be lucky to have her."

Class is mandatory to attend but is so unbelievably unnecessary. Possible to make an A if you are a good writer.

She is lenient on papers and will help, but don\'t email her because she will never email you back. I made A\'s on most of my papers, but she is a hard grader."

Either way, you would be lucky to have Dr. Collins. She is an educator of the highest caliber. It isn\'t part of my major, and I have yet to take a class I have enjoyed as much. She has passion for what she does and still keeps it on a fun and interesting level."

Lots of work goes into earning the grade but I loved the books we read and the support to think about everything and not just take it at face value. A REAL TEACHER! Teaching us to think for ourselves.

We would honestly sit there for the entire class period even when there was nothing to do. She is also not very clear on what she expects on papers, which is your entire grade. Close to if not the worst teacher that I\'ve ever had. Do not take this class"
