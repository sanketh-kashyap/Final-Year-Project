YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,"Professor Hwang is ok at teach the material, but sometimes she does go a little fast. She\'s an easy grader and if you attempt to work the problems, she\'ll give partial credit. She also provided many opportunities for extra credit. She is pretty funny if you catch her sense of humor."

She was very helpful, she would explain different ways to do the problems and was RARELY disrespectful to the students (sometimes someone would say something really really dumb though...) I always felt like my questions were answered well."

Joanne berates the students she does not like during class in front of the other students, very unprofessional. Joanne powerpoints are good but that about all. She rushes through material, when asked to repeat she gets upset. Her grading is not fair when she take off for comas."

Idk why people complain about her, I understand not everyone can grasp the concepts but its not like she doesn\'t offer help. She\'s always at her office and she always willing to help. She\'s nice too!"

But if you struggle in class DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HER! And if you get stuck in it plan to live in the learning lab and ask for Conrad (Round Rock Campus)

She doesn\'t try to surprise you or make the class impossible. she does have a lot of assignments and you do need to show up and pay attention. She is attentive and wants her students to succeed. If you show up and do what\'s assigned you will get an A.

The examples she uses in class are way different then the ones on the test. She does not have math teaching ability. Only take this class if you are willing to study and learn the material on your own!

On numerous occasions both students & tutors were unable to comprehend her questions on a quiz. You were out of luck with understanding the English of poorly written exams. Teachers have to demonstrate proficiency in English--so should Profs. Hire a translator for her written English.

She doesn\'t comprehend silence from the class means no one understands her. I\'d never take another class taught by Prof Joanne Hwang.

Not very good at explaining things for others with different learning styles. She teaches above the elementary class level.
