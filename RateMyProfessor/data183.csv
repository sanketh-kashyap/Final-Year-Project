I don\'t know why UOP hasn\'t gotten on all fours to get this guy here. Maybe because he\'ll make the current professors look bad. Anyway. He\'s very good.

Professor does a good job covering the basic materials but of course it is impossible to include an entire other class within biomechanics. Outside of class he\'s very nice and understanding of situations that come up."

Seems to have good experience in the biomechanics field. Very interactive teaching style (likes to have people work problems during class). Work load is not too bad: homework every 2 weeks or so but projects can be lengthy.
