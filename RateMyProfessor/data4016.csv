She ""gets"" education. She models what she is teaching and is a super fast grader. If you do the work, you will get a good grade. The hybrid aspect of her class was great and made the class more hands on. She is very approachable."

You get a lot of teaching experience in her class. I really enjoyed her as a professor!

She created a ""hybrid"" class with 1/2 online 1/2 classroom, and could not implement it at all. Never gave clear directions, changed them midway through, and had tons of busy work. The class content is somewhat useful, but could be taught without so much busy work amounting to little value"

I am a 3.6 gpa student who normally doesn\'t have to do much for classes. I spent 6-10 hours on homework each night of interim. Prof. is unclear, and impossible to follow. I was told on numerous occasions I was wrong (with no constructive feedback), even though I followed her directions."
