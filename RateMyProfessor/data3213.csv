He is very helpful, great at teaching, and his class is not boring at all. I wrote some of my best essays in his class because of his leniency and quality in teaching"

Then he was out most of the time for health reasons. He told us he was going to count attendance and changed his mind. I sent him an e-mail with concerns about the final 10 page research paper and he sent the rudest, most unprofessional e-mail back to the ENTIRE CLASS regarding the issue. After this bad experience, wouldn\'t recommend him to another student as long as I live! Very unprofessional."
