He knows who is learning and who isn\'t. If you\'ve proved to him that you know the material it\'s likely you won\'t need to take the final.

He knows what he is teaching and actually has experience. He doesn\'t just define and talk out of the book, he explains everything through his own experiences in the field. He is an awesome teacher and the best teacher I have had yet and this is my last semester at FCC. Take his class!"

I missed one large assignment that was worth around 10-15% of my grade and made it up by simply doing 2 extra credit assignments that were much easier! Great guy that loves to bash his ex-wives :D
