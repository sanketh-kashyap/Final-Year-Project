Great guy during office hours but depending on the day in lecture he can be cranky. TA helped WAY more than he did, kind of uptight. Class overall easy. 3 weekly responses every week each 170 characters and 6 exams, drops 2 lowest. No hard to get an A. Lot of busy work for sure and reading -- lots of reading!"

Unlike other teachers who demand the correct answer, he wants as much participation as possible & says ""there\'s no wrong/right answer.""There\'s only two tests, and 4 written book analysis. A LOT of assigned readings! Read as much as you can to get your daily participation pts."

Six exams and quizes every week. No review session or study guide for the exam. Grading was extremely arbitrary.

But overall, somewhat easy class. But boring and a lot of busy work. No papers but 1 EASYY group project (annotated bibliography)"

There\'s a reading response and an in-class exercise due each day & full points are not always awarded. He does not give study guides for exams nor does he review the chapter before the test. DO NOT TAKE CHINESE CIV!

The TA said this class becomes much harder than before. Three responds per week and usually you can not get full credits. Sometimes they give you very low grades without even a word feedback. This is a very horrible class, painful to get through and extremely boring. DONT TAKE IT IF YOU DONT HAVE TO."

Giele takes a difficult subject such as Classical Chinese and makes it enjoyable to participate and study. He will go out of his way to make you comfortable seeking any sort of clarification and is generous on his exams."

Can be a little dry if no one interacts, but a great class if you\'re involved. Knows his stuff. ... Completely unrelated to his teaching methods, but interesting- interesting way of pronouncing/using words. I\'d recommend his classes."

Professor Giele is VERY monotone which doesn\'t help. When approached he can be unfriendly or nice depending on the day. It\'s impportant to go to EVERY lecture to hand in a reading response. Quizzes are very easy. Midterm is curved and if you study the final is easy. I wouldn\'t take this class again

The easy tests and reading responses make up for his somewhat monotone voice. He posts all of his slides online and usually goes over information before we take a quiz each Friday. Take this class; if you read and attend, you will get an A."

There are 2 readings a week that you have to write about a paragraph about and turn it, and a quiz every Friday. He\'s not very nice when approached, and his slides are really bad. Don\'t take Chinese Civ!"

Easy A as long as you go to every class throughout the semester."
