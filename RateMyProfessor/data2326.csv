Elaine  Davis,Rowan College at Burlington County,Mathematics department, Pemberton, NJ,0,4.5,N/A,3.0,,1,04/14/2009,MTH075,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Mrs. Davis is one of my fav. math teachers in Fall 08. If your looking for a teacher who cares, as long as you care, then her class is highly recommended. Not only is she a straight up teacher who speaks her mind respectfully, because she cares, she also offers help outside of class on her time to those who are really trying:)"
