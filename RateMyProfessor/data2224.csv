During speeches I would look at her and she would roll her eyes at the students presenting if they made a slight mistake. That\'s not very professional. You are there to teach us not roll your eyes at us. So glad that class is over with! Good luck to anyone that takes her class.

Your grade is the effort you put in the class, so if you want an A and really show it, you\'ll get an A. She gives a lot of feedback and helps us to become better speakers. Shell occasionally crack a joke, but overall she was a very nice/easy teacher!!!!"
