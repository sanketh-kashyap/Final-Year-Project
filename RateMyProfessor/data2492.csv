This guy truly knows his stuff and is very relatable. His explanations are exceptional and he wants everyone to succeed. That being said, the class is difficult and requires practice. Utilize the Cadaver lab and go to class, and you will succeed."

Incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable about course content. He desires you to really learn the material and not just memorize. He is also willing to go above and beyond explaining material beyond what is expected for exams just for personal knowledge. would HIGHLY recommend. One of my absolute favorite professors by far!
