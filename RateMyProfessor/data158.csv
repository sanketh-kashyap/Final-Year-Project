Will stand in silence without a problem, which makes the class unbearably slow. The book Is awesome. Outline the problems in the book, it\'s not worth writing out the (optional) answers. Read the case, take the rule, move on. A final, can submit problem answers to her for feedback."

Never called on me once. By the end of the semester she called on the same 5 people. I felt unprepared going into Contracts II. She talks about her personal life way too much. Stay away if you can. My ILS TA Susan was really helpful though. I had Hatcher for K2 who was the best."

She likes to explain things to death, but that can be good. Her grading is very fair/Borderline generous. Only con is that going to her office hours is a waste of time. Her idea of helpful feedback is telling you that you need to do better. She won\'t tell you anything more specific than that. She\'s a nice lady though."

If you are respectful to her she is respectful to you. The text book she used was awesome!

Less than half of each class was about the material, the rest was devoted to unrelated tangents. I learned the entire semester from the book. Sympathetic towards students but still condescending and rude on a regular basis."
