Robin  Burton,Hudson Valley Community College,Accounting department, Troy, NY,1,2.0,N/A,3.5,,2,06/12/2010,ACTG110,3.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Not sure if he\'s still teaching but wanted to defend him. He was tough if you didn\'t pay attention or do your homework. Basically impossible to get help outside of class but if you\'re a good student he has a lot of experience to share and is a lot of fun.

I already have a B.A. but wanted to go back to college and take some refresher accounting classes. I will never select this guy again.
