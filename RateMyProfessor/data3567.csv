Pandurangan  Ramaraj,Los Angeles Trade Technical College,Biology department, Los Angeles, CA,0,2.5,N/A,4.0,,1,02/08/2009,BIOLO1640,2.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,He is very hard to understand because he has a heavy acsent. But I must say if you study hard you will pass his class. Although he gives lectures you must read the book also to pass his class. Other than that GREAT teacher.
