Carrie  Sperling,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,2,3.3,N/A,3.7,,3,06/23/2011,METWR123,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Horrible - I loved writing until I had her class. She was unclear and gave horrible feedback. Conflicted often against what she would say initially and was vague in what she wanted. Maybe she is great for second semester writing but for legal method and writing she was terrible.

After the nightmare that was my 1st semester legal writing instructor, Carrie has shown me the way legal writing should be. She goes out of her way to help students get their writing clean and strong, is very approachable, and has a friendly teaching style that is not stale or boring. Will take her adv. class next!"

Amusing and entertaining during class. Clearly laid out what she wanted. By nature, difficult to do well. Worthwhile class and a very good professor."
