Jenna makes things clear when you do not understand the text you are required to read. You should take this class it\'s an easy A and long as you read and the plays are easy to understand and interesting.

I thought the school\'s GE required only 3 English classes, apparently she didn\'t get the memo that this is a Theater class. She asks for 2-3 page essays and then tears the pages apart with her red pen so much that if you rewrote it to please her it would be 5 r more pages."
