Simply the best cse professor at csusb! You will learn a lot of things from this class (linux, bash, virtualization,etc.). You will need to put in a lot of your own time to learn more and understand the concepts. No regrets taking this class!"

You must learn most on you own, a bit hard to understand, but if you get him one on one its much better.. classes are late night, so hard to focus after a long day.. He is very unorganized :("

You must apply yourself, and if you do not know Linux, you will learn in his class, if you do, it will be good practice setting up a server environment. He has lots of experience, is understanding, and helpful. The only complaint is that he is a little unorganized but who isn\'t?"

Indeed, he teaches the material out the book. He also expects students to do their part. Just be ready and prepared do to the lengthy labs. He loves LINUX, but he does not hate Windows as the rest of instructors... He is recommended for all three courses he teaches. Good Job Ken"
