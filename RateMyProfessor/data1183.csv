Very helpful,and funny. Books are a must for her class and attendance is mandatory because she takes roll(just like in high school). She has a lot of group assignments so if you miss class, you lost out on group points."

She tells us what is on the exams and there are no surprises. I feel bad for her because she lost her husband in the middle of the semester. Easy class=A
