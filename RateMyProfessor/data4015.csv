I love his passion and enthusiasm. Until I took his class I thought geography was just about capital and location of things. But I was amazed to see what geography is all about. Although I got a B in his class, I still think he taught me so well that i would have earned an A ifhad focused from the beginning of the semester."

Geography is not hard but if you put no effort into going over the material it can come back to bite you in the you know what. Just read over the powerpoints a few times and go over the diagrams in the powerpoints and you will be fine.

That guy has more energy for an am class than humanly possible Great guy who really on cares about you learning as human.
