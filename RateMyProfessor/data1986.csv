She takes a different route when it comes to lecturing and her teaching style. While it may seem that she is lazy and super laid back, I probably learned the most from her classes over many of my other professors. She is very into team projects during class time and keeps everyone involved."

Attendance is required once a week for group activities and it does count as part of your grade. There is also quiz in class over a new chapter each week. Very easy A if you just read the book. Some might even get an A just by reading the chapter summaries. Not an exciting or highly information class/teacher.

Most of the times unprepared and not interested in the material. Easy class but I would recommend anyone else if you want to learn any material.
