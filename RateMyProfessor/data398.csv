She is the sweetest lady and will do anything to help you better understand and learn. She actually wants to get to know each and every person which is pretty cool. She does a lot of quizzes, so each one doesn\'t count for very much. 1 test, some presentations, quizzes, and an optional final--show up and you have an A!"

She was truly interested in the success of her students. Very little to no note taking in class. There was a book, but we never used it. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who knows basic sign language. Easy A if you make the effort to be in class and participate!"
