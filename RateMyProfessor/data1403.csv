While his classes aren\'t a walk in the park, he always tries to make the class interesting and is genuinely interested in wanting you to understand the material. I\'ve never seen anyone care about his students so much. He\'s a great help if you show that you want to learn."

Takes attendance beginning of semester but after awhile was not mandatory. One 5 pg paper due at the end.

Make sure you read the textbook before tests! Class really becomes a waste of time because you won\'t learn much.

He generally rambles on about common sense things during his 1 hour and 15 class and then tests you on hard things he never even discussed in class. I would definitely recommend using the textbook as your teacher instead of him."

He is a great guy and really knows what he is talking about. Class can get pretty boring and dragggggs at times, but he gets off track a lot, which makes it interesting.

The multiple choice exams are hard because they\'re so theoretical there could be 3 right answers, so it\'s impossible to get an A, but there\'s alot of extra work to get an A"
