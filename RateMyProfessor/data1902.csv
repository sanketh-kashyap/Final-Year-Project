Took her in the summer and even though she is fast paced and concise, I would strongly recommend taking her class. Made an A in there. Class isn\'t that hard as long as you pay attention and do a good amount of studying for her test."

Great teacher just come to class pay attention take notes and do all the extra credit she offers. Her tests are similar to the study guides so if you do everything she recommends you\'ll get at least a B or better in her class.
