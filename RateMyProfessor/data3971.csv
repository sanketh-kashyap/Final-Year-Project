Every class period you do an in-class activity worth ten points. The lowest I ever received was a seven. You NEED THE BOOK for the blackboard quizzes.

The technology issues were University issues with deadspots, not her fault. She covers material directly on exams, makes material easy to learn, and is very understanding to out-of-class situations if you\'ve missed assignments. she\'s a sweet lady! TAKE 130 WITH HER. I promise you wont regret it."

She had issues with technology and powerpoints. She got angry at class once for not answering a question. Working on the review may be helpful, I didn\'t do so well on the tests, and I\'m usually a good test taker without studying. Choose Bissell if you can if taking 130."

She was going through a lot of personal stuff this semester, but she was SO unprepared and unclear about EVERYTHING. It was super frustrating. Her tests were really easy if you go to the reviews and there\'s NO need to buy the book. She\'s super nice, but not a good teacher, at all."

She is very understanding and if you save the review questions from the clicker, they are usually the test questions. It is pretty easy if you keep up and attend class."

Projects not described in clarity, always confuses herself in lecture, and generally unprepared for class. It\'s not a hard class and if you pay attention you\'ll get an A."

Overall she seems confused when teaching and when you ask her a question she never has an answer. She does a chapter from the book in 20 minutes and most of the test is fill in the blank. Her tests are only 50 points while her projects are 100, so you can fail the tests and have an A in the class."
