The new field trip to San Carlos to collect material from the mantle was pretty tops. Other than that, don\'t trust what he says about his final exam; he says it\'ll be one thing then made it different."

Glad that he didn\'t have any tests in this class though, because the material was hard! Helped out a lot in lab, helps get you more interested in the subject."

Though this class was interesting, most of the information isn\'t useful unless you plan to be a mineralogist. The necessity of sheer memorization for parts of the exams is disappointing. Be sure to learn how to do the problems a few days before the exam, because there aren\'t examples in the notes."
