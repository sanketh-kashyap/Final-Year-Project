He stands right in front of what he is writing so you can never follow along. He doesn\'t answer questions very well and it\'s probably because he doesn\'t understand since he is foreign."

I am generally pretty good in math but struggled greatly in this class. I feel like I did learn the material and would have done great in any other professors class but he is an impossible grader taking points off for every minor detail. He also assigns online homework which is time consuming and not user friendly.

He is really smart and passionate about calculus. He draws good diagrams with different colored chalks to explain some things.
