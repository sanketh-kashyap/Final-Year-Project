Carolyn  Cheal,Oakland University,Art History department, Rochester, MI,2,3.8,N/A,4.5,,2,09/15/2011,AH101,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I took this class online. She has a very good idea of how to teach using this format. The class was surprisingly interesting but you have to do the reading; lots of names and dates. I got a 4.0 but the final was more difficult than I expected.
