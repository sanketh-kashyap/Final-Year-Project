She\'s funny, personable, smart, and really clear - one of the best teachers I\'ve ever had. I will definitely be taking more classes with her in the future"

Especially since it was 100 people and usually those classes are just lectures/boring. She encouraged thinking and interpretations in every class.

She\'s intelligent, humorous, helpful and extremely fair in terms of testing and workload. And unlike some of the other professors, she isn\'t arrogant and doesn\'t believe that only her ideas are correct. Simply an awesome teacher."

She is funny and is interested in having students figure out things as a class rather than straight lecture. Lectures are interesting.

Diverse and interesting book selection. One aspect I did not care for was the unstructured participation mark. Otherwise, pretty good class overall comparing literary works with their film counterparts."
