Although the class is somewhat rigorous, Tom knows how to convey the material in an engaging manner and the experience is extremely enjoyable. There are a few field trips and two very memorable camping trips!"

He is my favorite professor that I have taken at SFSU. Study once in group before the exam and always show. You will get a good grade. Very friendly, strange and sarcastic sense of humor. I will dearly miss this class. Everyone should take Plant Ecology with Tom! Also you learn so much in this class."

This is a really fun class if you are into the subject. This is a class for science majors, he doesn\'t dumb it down, which I liked. Not easy, but you can get an A if you study the power points and start the papers early. His directions are often unclear so be prepared to ask questions. He is always helpful when you do."

Yes, the average scores were in the 60\'s but he posts all the lectures online so if you read them you will do fine. I literally only went to class for the tests and I got a B. The reviewers that complained just didnt try very hard. He does have a sarcastic sense of humor but means no harm."

Lectures well and has interesting slides. If you are not a biology major DO NOT take this class. It will kill your GPA as his exams are very difficult. Your entire grade is based on two midterms and a final. Average grade on the mid term was 62, final avg was a 63."

His exams count for 100% of your grade and they are very difficult. He actually told us that since he had to suffer in college from a mean teacher who gave very difficult exams, he will inflict the same on us. Sadistic! Nice guy, knows topic very well,great powerpoints, but unnecessarily hard exams."
