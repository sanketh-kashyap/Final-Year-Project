GET READY TO READ,0,0,"Professor Kruglinski is a very nice lady but she is not easy going when it comes to papers and tests. Her museum papers and other ones are not easy at all. If you like art and you want to learn about it, take her, but if you take this class only to have another humanity class passed, don\'t take her because it os a lot of work!"

We have two quizzes plus one midterm and the final. Overall I hate the subject no fault of hers this is my 2nd bout. She does make it a bit more interesting than my previous professor. She is really great in the communication department as well so that\'s a plus.

She breaks down course materials so they are easy to follow and digest, and she is extremely helpful during office hours, always making a point to be there for her students when they need. Her lectures are entertaining and informative."

Everything\'s right out of the lecture and if you write down something you remembered next to a multiple choice question you think you got wrong she\'ll give you partial credit (!!!).
