This guy is a total leader. He knows what he\'s talking about and doesn\'t waste time with tedious work. The class structure is set up to build experience with team building and working in teams, along with presenting. Students have the opportunity to develop comfortable presentation skills."

He was incredibly helpful and quick to return feedback and grades for assignments. He put me into contact with a possible future employer and showed genuine interest in what my internship entailed. I hope I get the opportunity to take a class of his at school before I graduate.

If you want an easy A without learning a thing, go ahead, take his class. If you actually want to learn something, run from this guy. Who knows what he is like at the other schools where he teaches, but he appears to be bored and puts no effort into teaching this course. If you\'re really interested in business, find a better teacher."
