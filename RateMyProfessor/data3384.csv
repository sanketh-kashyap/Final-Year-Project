I\'m positive I am failing this class. The class average for our Midterm was a failing mark and she did not bell curve it. The textbooks were very expensive and were pretty useless because her lecture slides are composed of the textbook content. AVOID taking this class.. I wish I went with another option

Teaches everything even topics from past accounting courses that other professors taught poorly. She tells you exactly what is on the test. All you have to do it show up and pay attention. I do not know why her rating on here is so poor. She is an outstanding professor.

She is very hard to understand, does not help if asked, her pp give no help to understand chapter. Most of my class failed most test and had a huge problem with her as well. I am not saying this out of spite passed her class, but I would definitely suggest not to take her."

TOUGH GRADER,0,0,She was an average professor but not good for an accounting class. If you really pay attention and not get bored easily you\'ll get an A or B. She drops the lowest test grade and curves a little but only if the class really needs it. If you\'re an accounting major and you want to work hard then pick her.

She doesn\'t give you your test back to review so you won\'t be able to tell if she was really fair grading your paper. I remember she gave the class a question to study before the exam and I answered the question exactly the way she answered it in it and she gave me a zero for that question...
