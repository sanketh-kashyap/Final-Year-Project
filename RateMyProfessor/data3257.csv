Nelida  Torres,Virginia Union University,Languages department, Richmond, VA,0,4.0,N/A,3.0,,1,12/07/2014,SPAN201,4.0,3.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"There\'s a bit of a language gap with Prof Torres, as is fairly often the case with Spanish professors but it\'s not a big deal. She\'s very nice and helpful if you need it. If I was bad at language classes, I would not take her class though. I was one of the few that did not have trouble with her tests."
