THE QUALITY OVERALL IS GOOD. I could care less what she looks like or that she used to work for MTV, or whether she is a young instructor. Unfortunately The Deadlines for outlines are strict! No late outlines are accepted meaning you arent allowed to do your speech. That hurts ur grade Practical class but hard"

Make sure to ask a lot of questions because her instructions are very broad and you most likely get comments like ""you should have"" or ""I wish you would have."" When extra credit it given DO IT it ends up counting against you if you don\'t. But over all a good class."

She is helpful, kind, and she explans things in a way that is easy to understand. Tests are easy, just read the chapter right before each 5 question, multiple choice test. Activities are simple, fun, and informative. Mrs Payne is one of the best teachers at West Valley, and the best Communication teacher on campus!"

She forces you to get to know your peers around you so that when you make a speech you make it to friends and not just classmates. I love how she clearly explains what needs to be done and always gives positive feedback. If she every has an avaliable class, be sure to take her cuz she is awesome"

The material was a bit challenging because it really depends on how determined you are to do well on your speeches. Make sure to do the reading to ace those short quizzes, they add up. If you\'re disciplined enough you can easily get an A."
