Show your dedication for this class because she\'s quick to learn who doesn\'t care and awards those who do. She is personable and knows how to make a class laugh."

I recommend taking a bio class, before her class though. She is not your average ""eat this and be healthy"" type of Nutrition professor, she really breaks down the science of how food fuels your body! Her class is tough but well worth it! side note, all her exams if there\'s an ""all of the above"" that\'s the right answer"

Be advised tho her tests are hard but she provides study guides which are really helpful at least for the first two exams. Spends a lot of time on the chemical part of the subject which is pretty dry.
