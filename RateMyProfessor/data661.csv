TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"While this class was pretty difficult, Dr. Locklin is great professor. His tests were difficult but manageable, as long as you know how to do the homeworks and old exams well. In the end he will give you the grade you\'ve earned."

LOTS OF HOMEWORK,0,1,"Locklin is the best organic professor I\'ve had. Any OChem class would be hard, but his lectures were superb and he made sure to make sure everyone understood the material. Tests were VERY difficult, but he did recognize that - there was a sizeable curve at the end. Would definitely recommend."

This is organic chemistry so obviously it\'s a very hard class but he is the teacher to take. He cares how his students do and his notes are clear and easy to understand. Definitely go to class because his lectures help a lot! GREAT professor!

Go to his office hours even though his office is far away as he gives great one on one help.

Even if you read the text book and do every problem, the problems on the test are much harder. This class requires about 1-2 hours of studying a night to make a good grade."

Morrison explains the material better but overall, i think Locklin is more helpful because he really goes out of his way to help students understand the material and pass the tests"

He will help the best he can but mine was 300+ students and the class moves very quickly. I thought I knew material until I got to the tests, which almost always came back lower than I expected and hoped for. He doesn\'t use the book in class, but you definitely need it, because it helps tremendously. STUDY STUDY STUDY"
