Bill  Harmening,Lincoln Land Community College,Psychology department, Springfield, IL,2,5.0,N/A,2.5,,2,08/26/2011,PSY220,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Mr. Harmening is on one of the BEST psychology teachers around. Tests were take-home, but don\'t be mistaken...they were hard. We had 4 take-home tests, and that was it. He lectured over the material that he wanted you to know. He was not concerned if you needed to miss class. It\'s your grade."

He makes difficult subjects easy to understand, and always provides examples from his experience. He teaches only part-time, but I would love to take more of his classes."
