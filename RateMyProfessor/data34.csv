Jean  Carson,Dakota County Technical College,Nursing department, Rosemount, MN,0,2.3,N/A,4.5,,2,12/28/2011,PNSG1805,3.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I really enjoyed Jean. She has a great sense of humor and is truly a caring teacher. She commends you if you do what is expected of you and doesn\'t take you too seriously if you don\'t. All in all, she was very fair but a bit disorganized (not entirely her fault, however.)I would take her again in the future. Super nice :)"
