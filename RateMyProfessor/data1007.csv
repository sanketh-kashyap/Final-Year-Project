She wanted to be sure we learned and were comfortable with everything before our testing. Go to her office hours if you need help. I learned a lot.

When a student asked a question, she quickly breezed over a vague explanation and speededly moved to the next subject. She is extremely unapproachable and cold, and ""tricky."""

She is extremely helpful to anyone who actually goes out to seek help. My advice show up to class, ask questions and go to office hours if you need more help."

She is a joy to have as a teacher if you PARTICIPATE and SHOW UP TO CLASS!!! People who **** are the ones who never show up. She can be very funny & I enjoyed this class very much.
