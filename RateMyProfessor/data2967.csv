Very random and a little bonkers but he respects you and expects high quality work. Make no mistake though, if you want the A, it is very easy to get with him. Show up to class, rock out with him before class starts, listen to his funny stories, turn in quality paper at semester\'s end. Bam! A."

His approach to class is random YouTube videos and a couple papers. Most people in ENG 205 are there because they already took AP English. We all clearly knew how to write and he respected that. He was really laid-back in class but expected high-quality work. He was always willing to provide constructive criticism for assignments.

He tells you exactly what he wants and if you go above and beyond that he?ll love you. If you give him exactly what he asks for you?ll still get an A. Make sure you go to him with rough drafts when he gives you the opportunity, it?ll definitely help!"
