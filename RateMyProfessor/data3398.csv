Lectures are interesting, informative and funny. She tests you on exactly what she says she will test you on. Also the best looking teacher I have ever had. Wish I could take in other subjects. Favorite all-time prof."

Provides study guides for test that contain EXACTLY what she tests you on. Provides worksheets to help remember concepts. I really enjoyed her class! She gives you every opportunity to get an A. I wish she was teaching Bio 241 so I could take her again.
