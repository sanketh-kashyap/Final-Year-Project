Jeff  Spirko,East Stroudsburg University,Physics department, East Stroudsburg, PA,5,2.4,N/A,3.8,Tough Grader (1),9,05/19/2014,PHY1401,1.5,4.0,Not Mandatory,N/A,N/A,C,,0,0,"His class was very hard, and his tests were even harder. The examples he gave in class were nothing like the questions on the test. His explanation on processes are hard to comprehend. You need to understand concepts completely to understand questions. He doesn\'t curve tests even with class averages of 30 and 50. Very difficult class, unfortunetly."

Do NOT waste your money on him!! His examples are even more complicated!! He gives you the scenario, but does not explain plugging in the numerical information. ""he want\'s you to learn that on your own"" and he has a ridiculous ""umm, umm, umm problem!"""

Physics 2 is a whole different story. His teaching method is...well...non-existent. I\'m halfway through the semester and I\'ve learned basically NOTHING. GOOD LUCK!"

Ask him a question and he makes you feel like an idiot for asking in the first place. He only thinks that students deserve an A in the course if they\'re ready to take the MCAT physical science section. ALSO, his homework doesn\'t help you with the quizzes. BEWARE!"

My only complaint is that it takes him like 20 minutes to go around the room. Its understandable but annoying. Anyway props to him. Good guy overall.

Class isn\'t mandatory but he goes over everything in class.so you should go.His class is based on quizzes every week.
