Beyond that no direct feedback in regards to the work turned in was provided and the feedback offered was generalize to past experiences. Also refuses to grade about a 94% on an assignment because he feels that you will never continue to learn if you get 100%.

I am so thankful Prof. Gleason was my first english teacher. He taught me how to write papers and use these skills in other areas of my life.

However, you?re on your own figuring out the DB and IP. So if you?re able to interpret the task list you do well. If you do not understand the innuendoes you will not do well in his class."
