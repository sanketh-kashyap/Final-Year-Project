Mary  Cohen,Western Michigan University,Communication department, Kalamazoo, MI,1,3.2,N/A,3.0,,3,12/21/2010,JRN2100,2.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"As a graduate of WMU\'s Journalism program, I would like to comment on the below message. Mary was a terrible Journalism teacher. She is however, very knowledgeable in PR. (Not as much as DBH... LOVE HER!) She grades based on opinion, and doesn\'t know much about the nitty gritty of reporting. If only I had taken this class with Sue Ellen or Junger."

We were doing REAL reporting all the time, it was SO MUCH more relevant than a normal teach from a textbook class. Mary\'s awesome. It\'s a challenge, but a great opportunity that you should have no problem enjoying, especially if it\'s your major!"

She grades on a curve but the highest grade she gives is an 18 out of 25 but most people will get a 14. On exams if you don\'t put the answer exactly from the book you get the question wrong.No matter if you are close or not. I will say she is a nice person just not a good journalism teacher.
