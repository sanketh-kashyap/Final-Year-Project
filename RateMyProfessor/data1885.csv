He was frequently late, forgot to give assignments, and lost some students\' papers. The extra service hours would have been fine, had he not restricted the class\'s options. He\'s a very interesting and experienced professor, but very disorganized."

A lot of the material is boring and class consists of discussing the material. He is probably the most awkward professor I have met thus far. Takes random pauses in the middle of sentences, and questions students in rapid succession causing no one to want to participate. Grades papers harshly. I don\'t think anyone in class has gotten higher than a B+ yet. The class involved 3 hour field trips into the city that are pretty pointless. Don\'t take him."

It\'s a tough course, but I can not stress the amount of incredible information you will learn and how your perspective will change after this course. DEFINITELY go to Thad during office hours, or meet him at Boatwright! He\'s amazing to just talk to and is honestly concerned with his students."

Dr.Williamson is the most quirky man I have ever met and I loved every minute of it. He is very unassuming and humble even though he is clearly brilliant. Somewhat of an idealist but that has just made me more optimistic. Do the readings! They are hard but will enlighten you and you will bring so much more to class having read.

He really challenges his students to do critical thinking. There is a lot of reading (in justice and civil society) but most of it interesting and worth getting through. Class is discussion based and is usually very engaging. Williamson is a brilliant man and I loved taking this class from him.

Some of the best readings you\'ll have in any class in terms of breadth and variety. Unlike a lot of professors, he isn\'t afraid to state his beliefs although he doesn\'t force them on others. Very discussion oriented. Notes are primarily lists. Class not worthwhile unless you read."
