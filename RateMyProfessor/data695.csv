She grades things slowly and didn\'t answer any of my emails. She requires weekly journals but is a little unclear about what they should look like. The class itself was interesting, not too difficult as long as you do the reading. She did give us a week off of the weekly quizzes and discussions which was nice."

Tries to eliminate stress by reducing work load. Positive feedback, even though sometimes it was a little bit of a delay. Regardless she was amazing and I\'d recommend her to anyone."

She will reach out to assist you. You need only ask. If you don\'t want online, then don\'t sign up for online. She\'s even better in person. Friendly and very informative. But don\'t try to snow her with your research! Do it straight up!"

I only wish I had the full experience that I paid for. I was in a 4hr Saturday class which lasted 5 weeks. She didn\'t show to 2 of the classes. This is an easy ""A"" class but come on! I wish I could get a pay check for showing up to 3/5 classes."
