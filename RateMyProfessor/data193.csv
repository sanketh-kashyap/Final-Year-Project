He is a really sweet person, and he cares about his students. He drops a lot of low grades, and gives many extra credit opportunities. In my opinion, he isn\'t the best at explaining certain concepts, and lectures can be confusing, so definitely join a study group."

The teachers mouth would move but the words will become mumble jumbo. He understood the topic while the class was confused and couldn\'t get a question in at all.

I think he belongs in a lecture hall rather than a 10-20 student interactive class room. If you take all the notes, review them, do all the homework/handouts/quiz/ex cred and review. You will come to realize he was great. 18 months years later I still reference my ECON 102 notebook."

He gets caught up on one concept for weeks, and has trouble clearly explaining everything else. He also tends to miss subtleties and nuances, so be straight forward and only use vocab from the book in class. He gives you a lot of opportunities to improve your grade."

Gets nervous when teaching class, stayed on one chapter for a good 6 weeks (Chapter 3) causing our class to fall way back, not enough knowledge in material...frankly I don\'t know how he was approved to teach...my suggestion: when you spot this name, RUN!"

The class basically got stuck on one concept for the whole semester and really fell behind. Open note quiz once a week, and there was a take home final. He\'s a good guy, but hasn\'t quite figured out how to teach in a way that makes sense"
