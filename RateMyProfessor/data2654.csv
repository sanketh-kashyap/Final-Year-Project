Tends to go off-track sometimes with her stories. Always lets you out an hour early. Lecture you probably won\'t remember a lot since there\'s a lot to go over but exams aren\'t hard. Lab is where the fun\'s at and where you\'ll pay attention a lot. Can be a kind of stingy with points but not hard of a class.
