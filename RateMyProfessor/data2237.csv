I\'ve been interested in this stuff for a while, and expected to know much more than expected for the class. However, he humbled me and I ended up learning ten times more than I came in with. Your very fortunate to be taught by this grade A geologist."

He\'s the kind of guy you want to talk to after class. I do not excel in science classes by any means, but I studied enough and earned an A in the end. And I still remember what I learned. =) He just wants you to do your best and learn."
