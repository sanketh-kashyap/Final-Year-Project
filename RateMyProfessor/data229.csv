He?s a good choice."

It\'s really hard to find good professors at Baruch. But professor Park is simply amazing. He\'s super smart and extremely knowledgeable. You will learn a lot from this class. Exams are fair and his lectures are very interesting.

Super prepared, respects all students opinions and contributions, never rude. If he cant answer a question, he\'ll look it up and email the class about it. Baruch needs more dedicated professors like Park. You can tell he is really passionate about teaching, and does it well. LOADS of reading, hard work but worth it. TAKE HIM"

Park was the best professor that I had for Fall 2009. He comes to class well prepared, students engage in discussions. The class environment and teaching was well planned and interesting. Pr. Park is really nice, I think most of the Baruch professors should be as Mr. Park :) He shows greater respect to each student!"

But like someone else commented before, he has a Berkeley Phd. so he knows his stuff, and goes out of his way to teach the course in a way that everyone will understand. Helpful during office hrs Take him, one midterm, 3pg paper and final, or midterm, and 10-13pg paper. Good grader too"

HUGE amounts of tedious reading, some more boring than others, specially the more historical stuff. Still, not a difficult course to pass."

Extremely helpful and want you to make it through the course. Will bombard you with reading material but you can skim through it and be fine. 4 out of 5 quizzes counts towards your grade. You have to do the midterm but you can choose between 3 page essay+final or a 12 page research paper to substitute them both.
