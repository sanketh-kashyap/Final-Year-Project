Grading of papers is absolutely ridiculous. When assignment says 1-2 pages you better have 3! 1 full page does not meet her criteria. Emailed regarding an assignment and was degraded. Good luck with this ""Professor""."

She makes it seem like it has to be rocket science. It sucks knowin you can be really good at papers and discussions in this class, but she\'l just find something to make sure you dont do better than a B."

I have online classes so it is pretty much all on my own to teach myself. When I ask this teacher a question, she is nothing but rude. I hope to God I never have this teacher again- she doesn\'t TEACH!"

I have had trouble with her since day 1. When we had to chose an ethical issue, I chose fraud. When I got the grade back her comments on it said:This is NOT an ethical issue but instead it is a legal issue. WTF, The book says it is an ethical issue so what is the problem with it or is it u that has a problem w it???"
