However, he\'s not a very good advisor and he hasn\'t really helped guide me through the DIV process at all, which is a bit frustrating."

At this point, his facilitation and presentation skills need improvement to make class time effective. However, his genuine desire to teach was evident and he was always willing to meet or talk after class."

I did not know what to expect at the beginning. But, Ryan introduced his students to wide variety of Daoist, Buddhist, Confucian texts, rituals and practices. I came away with pretty solid understanding of Chinese religions and history. He is quite flexible and willing to help."

The course was inspiring and interesting at the same time. Ryan was very helpful and kind. He also made us think very critically about the category of religion in general and contemporary Buddhist ideas in particular.

He severely avoids answering questions esp. if they\'re controversial. He seems to know most of the material but he rushes through it when teaching & doesn\'t explain the components of Buddhism well enough. He is not too helpful as an adviser either. but as a person, generally adorable & caring"
