His class will prepare you with the tools necessary to be successful after graduation. He will make you work hard to earn your grade, but doesn\'t expect anything more than an employer would from you."

He doesn\'t teach the class, he plays videos of other people, and has students present in class. He doesn\'t seem to have common sense either he expects everyone to understand every industry out there and all the variables that each industry has."

Student evals of student presentations were a grading element, but when he didn\'t like what people were saying on the evals, he changed the grading to write them out. Avoid wherever possible."

Also he gave everyone an incomplete because he could not get all the grades in on time. The sound quality of the lectures were bad and he would not do anything to improve it. We never referenced the required book for the class. Everything he did teach was read straight from the slides. BAD!

Lecture audio quality was horrible. Gives essentially no feedback on graded homework, just a bunch of check marks. Gave the entire class an incomplete final grade at first because he couldn\'t grade fast enough before final grades were due. He is a useless professor."

He has the students do numerous presentations teaching the material and grades them on their presentation and their grading of their fellow students presentations. Great if you need to sharpen your presentation skills, but don\'t expect for him to actually teach you anything."
