Carolyn  Lewis,Louisiana State University,History department, Baton Rouge, LA,2,3.8,N/A,3.4,,12,07/06/2011,HIST2057,4.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I hate history but Lewis made me very interested in the topic. She\'s a big feminist and it showed through her lectures. I suggest taking her. Super helpful and passionate.

She lectures in a way that is not only engaging, but very emotionally enticing. I would often go to class and feel as if I was actually IN the time period being lectured on. If you\'re a history major and couldn\'t manage more than a C, you\'re an idiot."

I didn\'t have to put forth much effort to earn an A in her class. She\'s very interesting and frames her lectures in an intriguing way. Anyone claiming to have to put forth way too much effort in her class and only make a C does not belong at a university, much less as a history major."

This is by far the hardest class i\'ve taken at LSU. She tells you not to be vague in answering her essay questions and her ?\'s are about as vague and broad as you can get. Spent ALL my time working in this class and finished w the lowest C possible. Don\'t waste your time and effort"

Her papers will STRESS YOU OUT. She says don\'t be vague but her prompts are always vague and broad. Kind of liberal, but seemed like a decent person. Luckily, I like history, but if you don\'t and just want an easy A, she isn\'t for you"

The way she delivered her lectures made it easy to understand, and I found them to always be interesting. While attendance is not mandatory, she doesn\'t like it when you don\'t attend class (I always found the class too interesting to where I never wanted to skip)."

I worked very hard in her class, and managed to get an A. She\'s also really helpful outside of class and is flexible on grades. If you like modern American history and don\'t mind working for your grade, this is the class for you."

Some things brought up in her notes are unclear and do not appear in the book, which makes things hard for exam time. She doesn\'t care for students too much and grades her papers extremely way to hard. Would not recommend her"

I would recommend her if you need to take this class. I\'m a history major and I enjoyed having her. Easy enough A for me but still learned relevant information.

I had to start bringing my lap top to class just to keep up with her. She is out of touch with her students, and this is evident in her teaching methods. Sad to say I dont care for History as much anymore, and it is my major."
