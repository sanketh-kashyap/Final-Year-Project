Jean  Brouard,University of Victoria,Geography department, Victoria, BC,2,4.6,N/A,2.0,,4,12/22/2011,GEOG391,4.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"One of my favorite classes and profs thus far. A great subject that is very relevant here in BC. Jean is very friendly, knowledgeable, and fair, with a tendency to go off on tangents, which can be interesting. Lots of guest lecturers, some better than others. There are two essays, and a final exam and the evaluation was flexible and more than fair."

He is so knowledgable about everything, especially forestry. Made a 3 hour forestry lecture almost enjoyable. Marks essays fairly and allows you to redo."

A very knowledgeable teacher who is approachable and available for help outside of class. He marks essays fair, and will let you redo if u aren\'t satisfied. He has real-life practical knowledge which helps."

Penn (while she ran for the election). He\'s a silvaculturist by trade, not a professor, so his notes are simple. Though its a 3 hour lecture slot, every week had a new guest lecturer. Final exam questions were given, and easy. Very easy to negotiate with when you\'re not happy with a grade. A GPA booster."
