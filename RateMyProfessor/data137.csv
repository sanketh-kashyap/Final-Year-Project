Deborah  Smith,Southern Connecticut State University,Recreation department, New Haven, CT,5,4.0,N/A,1.3,Caring (1)  LECTURE HEAVY (1),3,06/12/2016,REC320,3.0,1.0,Mandatory,Yes,Yes,A,LECTURE HEAVY  CARING,2,0,"Deb really cares about what she is teaching and is really nice, though she is kind of crazy. Three projects throughout the semester, but if you do good enough on the midterm, you don\'t have to take the final. Her laugh is like one you have never heard before and one you will never forget."

The 320 class is basically geared toward community rec, sort of pointless for sports management, TR and travel and tourism but it is a mandatory class. Overall, its an easy class and she is a good professor. As long as you show up, act like you\'re paying attention and do the work she\'ll like you ."
