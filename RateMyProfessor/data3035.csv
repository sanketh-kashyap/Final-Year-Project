I\'m honestly surprised her rating isn\'t higher. Her papers are all connected and the way she designs them really minimizes your workload if you do it right and plan ahead. Her lectures are funny and can be inspiring. She\'s best in office hours though and always leaves a ton of comments.

She expects every student to participate in class discussion, so don\'t take her if you just want to listen to a lecture."

PARTICIPATION MATTERS,2,0,"While Bart is entertaining and had interesting insights, her lectures tended to be unstructured and difficult to take notes on, rarely changing my view of the text significantly. She was often unclear about expectations for assignments. She\'s not a bad teacher, but Hillsdale has so many other truly great English profs-- take one of them instead."

It is obvious that she wishes that all her students would attend grad school. A little difficult for a 300 level class. Laugh at her jokes and talk to her. Be ready to read a lot. She may spend 2 class periods on one page of literature and 5 minutes on a whole entire work.

Very well educated in her area of expertise, makes reading and class enjoyable and super educational. Don\'t take her if you\'re looking to skate by, though.

Her lectures are extremely disorganized and impossible to take comprehensible notes on. Also useless during office hours. She talks way too much without having anything interesting to say. For her tests - study all of the random pictures she hands out in class and memorize all of the foreign words that she mentions.

She acts like she is teaching graduate students not freshmen. If you go to talk to her she will talk forever without saying anything helpful. Tests are extremely hard but it is possible to do well. Her grading scale for papers is based only on which students she likes.
