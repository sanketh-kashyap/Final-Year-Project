She came back this semester to teach when really she should have been recovering from cancer treatment. She is a hilarious, passionate professor that has really impacted me as a student.

She looks out for her advises. The subject matter of Sociology, cults and communes was interesting. Lots of discussions. One field trip. The subject matter lost its interest somewhere along the way but it was a great introduction to WU."

Though attendance is supposed to be mandatory, I honestly felt as if I could have missed every class and still aced the two tests. This class doesn\'t require you to think, just to regurgitate what you have read. Aguilar\'s teaching methods are rather ineffective, perhaps attributable to her inexperience."

I don\'t think the class always sees her as an authority figure. There\'s a lot of discussion, which is good & bad. If you do assignments, you\'ll do well on them. It bothers me that she doesn\'t seem to know any science, but that\'s a small part of soc. She\'s enthusiastic and overall good."
