She\'d spent years in China and had much to offer the class. Class was essay intensive--she was honest about it up front & was very prompt with grading. She showed a genuine interest in her students, going above and beyond to help bring out potential."

This teacher has the biggest ego ever! Don\'t know why she is still at MC???? I believe she teaches this class just to get her students to buy her book that is useless to the class. She is very unclear, unorganized, and quick to shoot down any opinions she doesn\'t feel fit hers! Good luck!"

When she says something nice, she makes you feel really good about it. I think she knows that she is disorganized & makes it up by going easy on a few things."

She is extremly critical, rude and ruthless! She picks apart her students and shoots them down when you antempt to give your point of view. She goes on and on about her book and her background. She does not belong at MC! Its a true shame!"

I loved the openness in which we could debate & yet we still remained respectful of everyone\'s views. I like the she pushes us to think outside our comfort zone. Her class was a pleasure to be in & I would highly recommend it to future students. She is very nice & always willing to help too :-)

She\'d be a perfect screenwriting teacher, but she doesn\'t show us much about politics, probably because she\'s trying to sell her book. She says ""there\'s no wrong answer"" and when you turn in your work everything is wrong! She\'s ruthless about grading,you probably won\'t do well if you\'re not a natural born critic"
