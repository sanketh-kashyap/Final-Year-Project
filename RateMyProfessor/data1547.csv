He\'s a native French speaker but he doesn\'t have a hard-to-understand accent. He gives a ton of extra credit and gives you plenty of opportunities to boost your grade. He doesn\'t assign some of the stupid parts of the online bit of the class, which is nice. The book you use will be used all the way to at least FREN201."

Don\'t get me wrong, I have learned things in his class but sometimes he is strict about things such as the class not knowing a certain tense or il est vs c\'est. Study for his quizzes, do your essays and homework and you\'ll be okay. He\'s a cool guy but feel like he wants to be teaching a movie class instead."

He\'s very intelligent and knows a LOT about French culture. He\'s also super laid back and very interesting. Just pay attention and ask questions if you need help and you\'ll be fine. This class has inspired me to pick up French as my minor and I\'m more interested in traveling now more than ever.
