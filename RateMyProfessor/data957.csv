Study hard for tests, they are quite comprehensive. She really helped the class out by offering lots of extra credit which is highly recommended you do. She can be really fun but stay focused in class and review your signs when not in class so you\'re prepared and you\'ll do fine."

She doesn\'t follow the order of the book and the exercises and hand outs on not often clear. She canceled our class due to her personal issues . She graded unfairly embarrassed certain students in class. Take another route if you can.

You\'ll enjoy her class, it never feels like work. The only thing she is up tight about is cheating during test taking. I\'ve take her for 10a and 10b, and going on 10c. Shes awesome!"

I highly recommend you take this class. You will not regret this at all."
