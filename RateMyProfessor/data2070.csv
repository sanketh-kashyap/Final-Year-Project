I took both spanish 2 and 3 with her and she was great! Don\'t take her if you want an easy A, but if you work hard an A is very possible. She WILL teach you spanish, unlike the other professors in the dept who don\'t really know how to teach. Would highly recommend her to anyone interested in learning spanish."
