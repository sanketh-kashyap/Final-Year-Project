The class is super fun, and if you\'re bad at science I think you\'ll like this course (it doesn\'t even feel like a science class)! It\'s a very easy course too you\'ll most likely get an A (assuming you won\'t skip class a lot)"

Although it\'s a long course once a week, Buffy really makes it interesting and fun. Don\'t second guess, take GIS!"

Lectures give good info on how to use the ArcGIS program. No worries if you have trouble in class, she\'d be more than willing to help out. Easy to get a decent grade in this class as long as you keep up on the projects."
