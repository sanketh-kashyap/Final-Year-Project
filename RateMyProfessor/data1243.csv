That is fine, but he shortens the test reviews and tells you to email him with questions but when you do email him he is rude and claims to have covered it. His rudeness is unbearable but tests are the easiest things in the world, straight from lecture"

He gives you the exact information you will need for your tests along with bringing in historical artifacts that pertain to the lecture that day. He does like class discussion, so speak up."

He\'s truly useless- he\'s somehow the Director of the Journalism department, which is why it\'s completely failing. He is always completely unprepared for class, you can tell he makes up assignments on a whim. He\'s also incredibly condescening and rude."
