Workload was decent. Expectations for assignments could have been a little better defined. Enjoyed the guest speaker series and the group projects.

I had some trouble because accounting isn\'t my major, but Professor Whatmore is very patient and willing to help. The tutorials for the assignments are really helpful and if he doesn\'t finish he makes sure to email everyone so that everyone understands. Really good person."
