What\'s more frustrating, he interrupts students during exams to make announcements. Some of his jokes/anecdotes are unprofessional as well, and his assignments are unclear."

TEST HEAVY,0,0,"Ronald is the most unprepared teacher I have ever had. He\'s a bird expert, not an anatomy prof, & it is more than obvious in his lecturing. Lecture is 1 hour lost that could\'ve been spent studying/learning on your own. Gives incorrect/incomplete descriptions when accuracy & precision are important (anatomy is particular). Take Nodzak if possible."

Watch sitting in front of him as he tends to make it rain spit. He is a very cool dude and his accent will make you giggle. Very helpful and is pretty lenient on giving partial credit if he thinks you know what you are talking about

He\'ll help with any questions, redo any experiments, show you any dissection until you understand. He is great with getting back to you if you send him an email also. Anatomy lab is hard but absolutely loved him."
