Assignments/quizes were kind of a joke since he seems to just grade them liberally. Great prof if you need the class to just pass, bad if you actually want to learn some geology I guess. Oh yeah, he no showed of the field trips lol :P"

His class is fun depending on who you sit with because the people you sit with are the people u will be working with. Test are easy and 90% of the work is in groups. If u ask for help he gives u the answer pretty much.Over all he is a very chill dude and so is the class!

But he doesn\'t lecture for long. He is very helpful and clear. I really enjoyed his class. Plus, he lets you leave after you are done with your work."

But seriously, who wants to learn Geol anyways. He lets u do group tests and labs so u can make a group of like 4 and just do it together. First test wasn\'t group but second was. Nice guy but kinda awkward. Infatuated with penguins."

We didnt do a whole lot, considering he\'d mumble for a few minutes and then let us try and figure it out on our own. If you want to learn, don\'t take this class. If you want to pass, go ahead, because it\'s not too hard. Ultimately, it wastes time, and isn\'t very interesting with him teaching it."

He is very easy going and a very fair grader. Even the boneheads of the class passed. I actually like geology and passed with a B+, only b/c i missed a fieldtrip due to work."
