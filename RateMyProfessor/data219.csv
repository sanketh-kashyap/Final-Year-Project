This class is hard though, and the tests require a lot of studying. Tested on material that we weren\'t taught, and that test questions were worded hard. This class is doable though if you are willing to put in time to really understand. She likes students that ask questions. Save $, Use ebook."

However, keep in mind this is a low-level nutrition class so questions you ask that deviate from the material, it doesn\'t seem she has the answers to. Attendance isn\'t mandatory, but it really helps pass the tests."

She is organized and always had assignments graded and back the next class. She made difficult concepts easy to understand. I learned so much in this class that will be useful forever.

I can\'t say the same for some of the teachers in the FCS building. I\'ve heard people say that the class is hard or the tests unclear... but of all my classes...
