Mario  Rivera,University of New Mexico,Public Administration department, Albuquerque, NM,3,3.2,N/A,2.7,,9,08/10/2012,PADM551,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Dr. Rivera is a remarkable professor, mentor and scholar. His mastery of theory, intergovernmental relations, and program evaluation is second to none. The amount of course work is average for a graduate class and he expects students to take responsibility for their academic success. That said he is very accessible. I highly recommend him."

He is intelligent and analytical. Aalma maters include Harvard and Notre Dame. He is not dismissing your opinion. Just having an analytical discussion with you. Committed to his class lectures and not a social butterfly. He expects you to learn as a graduate student. Ask ?s in and out of classroom. Nice Guy!

His lectures are boring and bias...doesn\'t like when students get invloved or challenge his ideas. No class facilitation...grades easy, but if you question him or challenge his ideas good luck getting a good grade. Never gives good feedback. Horrible!"

He taught well and put responsibility upon the students, but at a graduate level it is normal. Obviously very knowledgeable."

Very brilliant teacher."

Rude to students (interrupts, disinterested in comments, leaves during presentations, email communication is very poor). Knowledgeable, but passes the (teaching) buck to students, and therefore it\'s incredibly difficult to leave his class with anything of value learned/gained."
