Probably best to sit close to the front to keep awake. Be VERY careful with how you write for essays and exams. She\'s pretty picky when it comes to writing errors. Book readings not necessarily required, but online readings are necessary for participation credit."

She\'s clear and passionate about this course, Global Baroque. This is her first time teaching the class she created and I love it. She expects you to come to class and do the reading, not unrealistic, good grader, exams are godsent. Loved this class!"

She doesnt tell you anything that isn\'t in the textbook and frequently has to look up information because she gets confused, forgot or just didn\'t know. I would suggest not taking her class if you don\'t have to."

She is can be a pretty difficult grader so make sure to put as much info as possible in your exams and essay! It wasn\'t too much work and I definitely could have gotten an A if I studied more for the midterm. In the end I don\'t regret taking the class."

She is a surprisingly tough grader, so be careful taking her tests/writing essays. Just put as MUCH info on the paper as you can. I would not take a class with her again."

Very nice and enthusiastic about the subject. Very helpful in office hours. Class isn\'t too hard, only one short paper. Exams are essay questions, but they are given to you before the test. I would definitely take another class wiht her!"

Doing the readings honestly enhances your view of the class. Lectures started dry but tended to get better as the semester progressed. Wonderful professor and very helpful and knowledgeable during office hours.

Sometimes picky with style of writing. Very interested in the topic. Not enough research on most of the subject so at times she seems unsure. I thought overall she is easy, sometimes a little dull. Nice professor"

Even if you memorize her SKEWED version of the facts, she will take off points and grade you down-Is elusive if you confront her about grades and doesn\'t seem to know the material. Only professor I have ever evaluated as poor! DO NOT TAKE! Subject was interesting, she is NOT!"

This woman can bore anyone to sleep; oh well, at least the class was easy. All you need to do is read the textbook and study the images. Nothing else. The textbook is more interesting than her."

You can tell she loves art history and gets excited about teaching it. Tests weren\'t too hard but you have to memorize a lot of images and everything is fill in the blank. Don\'t really need the book at all as long as you go to class and take notes.
