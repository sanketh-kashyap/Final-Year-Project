I cant believe she still teaching, I guess Ryerson is that desperate. I have no words to describe her, its one of those things that leave you speechless bcuz you just dont think there\'s people like that on eath...it makes you wonder how somebody like that has gotten thru life. you gotta experience it yourself to know what i\'m saying!"

In my mind (and others) this class was a waste of time. She could be a great teacher if she wanted to (se expained a few problems when students requested some help)-but no (she prefers easy way out). She wants students to figure out everything themselves. She has very low teaching skills.

Makes fun of people. Don\'t take her if you have a choice. I was stuck in her class coz I needed it to graduate.

Hard to understand, takes long to start tests/exam & classes as she calls everyones name for attendance, makes unnecessary rules like must say your last name first or she\'ll scold you. Went into this course expecting A finished w/ C- my lowest grade this yr. (my highest was A+) BEWARE"

I had been trying very very hard to focus on her class, but I failed. totally wasting time going to her class. I have signed up another course this fall, when I found out she is the professor, I swapped."

Lacked organization and constantly talked during the midterm. Accent quite thick and keeps using examples from other books, which of course you can\'t refer to later on for examples."

Rarely went to class because I couldn\'t follow her due to her accent. She does not clarify what she expects and marks difficult on the assignments. However, it is still better to take this course with her over Terry because her final was pretty easy and she focused on the basic stuff."

She does not explain clearly, skips steps and also makes mathematical errors. Literally half of the students get up and walk out of the class by the break. Nice person but extremely confusing."
