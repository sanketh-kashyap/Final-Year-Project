She dos not get off topic and is very direct. Her ppts are helpful but she teaches strictly out of the book. You can catch up if you miss a class. It was only Bio 100 so she did the job she needed to do. Nothing fancy

She uses a lot of sarcasm sometimes, so you just need to know how to take a joke! She\'s really nice and young, uses blackboard WONDERFULLY. Your grades are usually posted the day of whatever you turned in! Would highly reccommend!"

I felt more like she lectured AT us instead of teaching the material to us. She just wanted to spout her knowledge instead of trying to educate us, especially on the biology section. She could have structured the classes better so that they weren\'t so lopsided. One lecture was 45 mins and the next was 3 hours."
