I didn\'t even have to buy the book because she was so thorough. Very understanding, my cat ran away, and she let me leave class to go find him. Chemistry is not the same without her. Wish she taught organic here!"

She is clear, easy to understand, and knows how to teach! Afterall, she has a teacher degree too! This is so important, especially because it is a chemistry class. She is so fair, so clear, and so amazing at what she does. Her classes have lots of extra credit and the tests r easy."

As a nursing major I\'ve taken many science classes (CHEM 110, 121, 131 BIO 118 160 260 241 242 NUTR) The best. Extra Credit, Good tests, clear instruction. Wish she could have taught all my classes."

Attend classes and take good notes you\'ll be fine. Always willing to help in anyway she can. I took her when she first started teaching in like 2001, nothing has changed about her teaching style but still very good at what she does."

Amazing teacher, just take good notes off her pwrpts and you\'ll be set! Very clear in her lectures, goes slow enough to allow good notes but not so slow that you\'re bored. I wish she taught bio as well!"

About the comment below you do have to study if you want an A, if you don\'t you will get C. Her test were tricky but she wants you to understand it. Great teacher and I like her a lot, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

I never had to refer to the textbook, i only opened it when i had to do the chapter reviews. She offers extra credit on the tests which are EXTREMELY easy. Best and easiest teacher by far. I never study for her class and I have an A! Take her class if you get the chance."
