Steven  Coughlin,Ohio University,English department, Athens, OH,5,4.8,N/A,3.3,,6,07/28/2014,ENG2020,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Steve has been by far one of my favorite professors at OU. I would highly recommend this professor to anyone. I always looked forward to going to class because he actually made it enjoyable! There is homework every night but it\'s not graded hard at all! Be sure to take good notes because both the midterm and final are open note and book (yay)!

It seems like he doesn\'t really enjoy giving out A\'s though. Theres a lot of homework, and you definitely should not miss class. You cannot turn in any make up work or anything in late. He\'s definitely a nerd!"

I came out a better writer and didn\'t even like english to begin with. I would reccommend him to anyone, but you do have a lot of writing/homework, so prepare yourself. Other than that, I enjoyed his teaching style & class!"

Homework every night, two page typed responses. He is VERY helpful though and explains exactly what he wants. If your not willing to put in large amounts of time and effort, DON\'T TAKE THIS CLASS! I hate english, but I came out of this class a much better writer and student."

He keeps things lively in class, always cracks jokes and is actually humorous, and is crystal clear in what he wants. Lots of homework, but it\'s simple. Quizzes, but he lets you use notes. Can\'t go wrong with this guy, all around awesome experience in his class I hate English, but he made it fun."
