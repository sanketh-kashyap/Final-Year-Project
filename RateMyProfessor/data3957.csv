She is a pretty tough grader, but that\'s what you\'d expect in a college class. As long as you put in a little effort, you can get so much out of this class. I definitely recommend taking French 106 with her!"

She graded not based on the quality of your work but on whatever she felt like. I scored A\'s on tests but C\'s on anything subjective. She can\'t explain her subject well at all. We did more work in this class then the 200 level classes and we got less credit. Avoid avoid avoid.
