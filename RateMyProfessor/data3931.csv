Assigns a group project and paper... as if college students have the time to work on a group paper. Class attendance is mandatory although everything she lectures is useless. Just read the book because all of her test questions come from the book, as do her lectures. Even the smartest students are just passing her class."

She can barely speak english, which by itself wouldn\'t be bad, but she can also barely teach. She doesn\'t make her quizzes, they are from another school where I\'m assuming the professor actually teaches the curriculum. Midterms and final are easy if you spend all day reading the book."

All lectures are straight from the powerpoint slides that the book supplied. Doesn\'t provide outside examples and if you have any questions regarding the material she redirects you to look for them in the book. STAY AWAY from this teacher if you can. Half of my class ended up dropping

HUGE MISTAKE. Avoid at all costs! Can\'t Understand her accent at all. Says Jokes and gets mad that no one understood her. She Gives impossibly hard quizzes and midterms. I dropped the class after the midterm. The class was 65 min. long & had 160 questions (many of which were not covered at all). avoid!
