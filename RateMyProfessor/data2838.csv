For signals, it\'s all powerpoints and follow the material. Hardly used the textbook. Last 4 weeks very difficult, but second midterm is take-home. Have never been to her office hours- hard to get an appointment with her. Nice lady, will help if you ask to go over hw in class"

I have to give her great credit since she has designed the course well enough as to give students the necessary exposure to BIOE where she invites numerous faculties and professionals for lectures. Her lecture is decent in terms of pace and content. But, she may speak with accent and softly."

Sometimes a little boring, but she\'s very helpful when it comes to office hours and clearly explaining things."
