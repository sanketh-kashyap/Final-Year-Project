PARTICIPATION MATTERS  CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA,1,2,"She makes the class easier than expected. Leaves very little amount of homework and the quizzes are generally easy if you\'ve been keeping up with the class. There is little down-time outside of class, which made this a very easy to follow class. She is strict within the structure of her syllabus and due dates. Do your homework and study!"

Try to do well on the quizzes! they count for more than you\'d expect. the homework load is pretty sizeable, but she spaces it out well so you always have time to do it if you make the time to do it. She seems intimidating, but is really helpful."

The pace of 121 is much faster, you\'ll have an exam every other week, and frequent tests, and journals. You\'re gonna be learning a lot of vocab every couple of weeks, but If you kept up in 120, then you should be fine. ayumi sensei is wonderful :)"

Definitely the one you want to take if you\'re looking to take Japanese at Grossmont. Frequent tests and exams, and 1-2 pages of homework due out of the workbook every day, but it\'s not overbearing. The pace of the class was excellent, the cultural discussions kept things interesting. And she\'s really nice! A+, Sensei. =)"
