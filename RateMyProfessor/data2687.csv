Broke a table in my class explaining microphones. Took class during Summer B so it was very quick. Easy class with open notes test and quizzes. Pay attention and print/write notes and you\'ll be fine. There is a video project that can be a pain, but that is the only bad thing. ONLY PROFESSOR TO BREAK A TABLE!!! EPICNESS!!!!"

Lectures get pretty boring, but he himself is a great teacher and he adds humor to everything he teaches. If you make a name for yourself the first day, he WILL target you for the rest of the semester as the butt of his jokes. Tests are open notes and labs are very easy so this grade is completely reflected off how lazy you are"

He glides across the stage like a glorious Lion and teaches with the voracity of a professional ice skater. And I\'m being dead serious, he\'s an amazing teacher that I would take over and over again!"

He has his own digital media company for freakin sake. The power points can get boring, but he makes it fun. The best teacher at UCF that Ive taken as of yet. Doesnt post grades but its open note tests so its not a big deal unless your an idiot and have bad grades in this class, seriously easy A, take it, bring up your GPA"

He knows anything and everything about digital video and audio production. He does take attendance but apparently you can miss a lot of classes before he starts taking points. Open note tests and exams!? What more could you ask for?

His lecture tend to be a bit hard to sit through (Sorry!), but he will try to bring in props sometimes to keep us entertained. But why, Mr. Gromak, for the love of all things good, would you pick Kenny as a lab instructor for this class?!"

His system of distributing grades is extremely flawed. I didn\'t even know I was doing bad until after the class was over. He never posts grades online. Be careful."

He works from these awful powerpoints with cheesy how to videos that are just sad. He\'s a nice guy, and he seems fairly knowledgeable, however he\'s too eager to stick to the syllabus which sucks."
