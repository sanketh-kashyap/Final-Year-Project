I\'m not the best writer so I struggled. I also particpated a lot and still only got a 90 for participation; be ready to discuss, discuss, discuss. You only have to do 3 virtual sessions which aren\'t bad but participate as much as you can."

Her online class is so easy. We never have to meet, we only have to post 3 topics per week. As long as the posts are relevant to what you\'re suppose to be reading that week, you\'ll get 100. Easy class, nice teacher who is willing to work with you. Def. take this class!"

Very easy and laid back-3 short postings due per week with a take home midterm and final and short paper. Her readings (no textbook, just articles and videos posted on BB) for some weeks can get lengthy, but as long as you put the effort in, you\'ll do fine."
