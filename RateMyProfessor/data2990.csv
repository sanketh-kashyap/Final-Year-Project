Very fun-loving, incredibly smart, and caring. Papers are challenging, but in a very good way, and she WILL help you with it if you are struggling at all. (Forces you to go to see her to pick up your papers.) Easy to talk to. Best writing teacher and best teacher I\'ve ever had at UCSB. I highly recommend her for Writing 2."

I loved every thing about her class, although sometimes the papers were a little frustrating due to their complicated nature. Her office hours are extremely helpful though and she is extremely accommodating for meeting times outside of class. If you tell her what\'s up, she will find a way to help you."

The writing class wasn\'t too hard, just follow all instructions she provides and ask ANY questions you ever have. Great teacher, she will be missed next quarter! Make sure to get her as your teacher."

I learned SO much. Maureen is an AMAZING professor who truly cares for her students. She really wants you to do well & is always available outside of class. She\'s super funny too. Too bad she isn\'t teaching Mus15 anymore b/c I would\'ve recommend it to everyone!

Too bad I\'m a senior and can\'t still be a music minor, cause she definitely made me want to be. Vincent was hysterical, tough grader though. She\'s teaching Writing 2 next Fall and I HIGHLY recommend her!"

She loves what she is doing and will go out of her way to help everyone. It helps to go to lecture... I never used the book. Not once, it is useless, but you do need the CDs for the class. As long as you study before the test and practice for the listening portion you will score an easy A."

Tests are a joke, but you still need to study the material to do well. Whether you get an A or a B really depends on your TA, which I didn\'t think was very fair, but that\'s life. Concert reports are annoying but easy. Maureen is a very nice lady. Unfortunately she is no longer teaching Mus15 after this quarter :("

Shes a great lecturer and loves meeting her students in office hours. Pretty easy if you\'re willing to put a bit of time in. Sasha is a great TA too. 3 short papers and a few section assignments. Required to attend 2 concerts. overall, great class!"

As a music minor, it wasn\'t hard for me, even for those taking it to fulfill their Arts req its pretty easy. Fulfills writing req broken up into 3 short papers which rly helps. Vincent isn\'t that bad of a TA, if u go to office hrs he rly helps u on the paper."

Would be an easy class if I didn\'t have Vincent as my TA...he grades unfairly on papers and all other TA\'s give out A\'s like there\'s no tomorrow. Other than that, it\'s a fun class with information i\'m never going to use outside class but It\'s a good unit and GE filler."

Just don\'t say you heard the first piece of your concert when you really showed up ten minutes late and made up the fact that they tuned before. She\'ll report you to the Office of Judicial Affairs and give you a Zero. Shoot. Other than that, easy A, fun class."

She tends to treat the class like kindergartners, but that\'s not really a bad thing. There are 3 papers but they\'re really not very hard. Go to lecture because the tests are all on her lectures, not the book. If you are struggling, the TAs and Maureen are all very helpful!I recommend the class"

This is her first quarter teaching and like how she tries hard to make connections with the course material and the students. She can be a little scatter-brained, but what Music Professor isn\'t? She\'s great and I\'d recommend the class to anyone."
