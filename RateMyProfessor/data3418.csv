Some people love this class, but if you want actual feedback this is not the class for you. He does not admit when the program is messing up and usually blames the student. Also, you have no way to check your grades. You would be better off to take the class online."

CARING  GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK,1,0,"I really enjoyed this class there are graders assigned, and your attendance counts as 10% of your grade. Initially the Instructor can seem very straightfoward and abrupt but he truly does care and will go above and beyond to help his students. If you need a cheerleader, this is not the guy for you! He is SO knowledgeable and you will learn so much"

He appears open to assisting people but then when he goes to assist you, he makes it feel like you are stupid. He calls attendance early and he can care less about students as far as class life and personal, as of they never mix."

Prior to his class I would consider myself to have basic computer skills (email, surfing, minimum Microsoft word) but after his class I\'m much more knowledgeable. Microsoft Access wasn\'t my favorite but I passed that section, he\'s ALWAYS willing to offer extra tutoring for those that need it. Smartmouth but he\'s cool!"

He doesn\'t let me finish asking questions (he\'s stopped me in the middle of a question twice when I\'ve had my hand raised) and he\'s quized us on the fine print of a chapter before we even went over it in class... I couldn\'t be around someone like him all day
