He doesn\'t give multiple choice or matching assignments; every assignment requires excellent writing with clear reference to the text, his lectures and outside sources if possible. He spells it all out in his syllabus. Amazingly, he reads every paper from every student and gives helpful feedback."

He truly listens to you when you speak. His classes are either writing intensive or a mix of both from my experience after taking 3 courses with him. Pay attention to his lecture in class, and fully understand the topic you are having a test or paper on, and you will do fine"

One example that sticks out in my mind: he was telling the class we should all be philosophy majors, and when a student asked what the use of said major was, Cantens stammered, provided no intelligible answer, and went back to his lecture."
