Makes absolutely no sense and rambles about the most random stuff but the class is so easy. All homework & quizzes are online = open book. Hard to follow but write everything down that he writes on the board and you will pass. He practically gives all homework and quiz answers to you.

His teaching methods are crazy. He goes off on rants that make no sense. You wont learn a thing in this class but if you do the online work, you should get a pretty good grade. You wont learn a thing but its an easy class."

And weekly. No midterms, but a few in class quizzes with open notes, but his notes don\'t really help considering his methods are insane. Despite this, you can coast through and get a decent grade."

He will help you on the quiz if you ask him for help. He lets class out early. There is no need to prepare for quizes as they are open note open book. You MUST understand how to do the sample final it is completely the same as the final! He gives an oral final that is easy. He drops your 2 lowest quizes. He is a nice guy.

He means well, but his lectures make no sense at all. I took him for both acct classes and did not learn a single thing. His lectures relate to nothing to accounting and they are a waste of time to go to. Everything is online and open book, open notes and easy grading."

He makes no sense, and the majority of his lectures have nothing to do with accounting. He refuses to teach from the book, and will make up his own methods of accounting and try to teach you those. would highly recommend NOT taking his class. Learned nothing."

Just because his tests are open note doesn\'t mean you should take him. I\'d rather have no notes, but be taught in class."

However, some things were extremely simple. I thought I was going to fail at first but I got a B+ so its not too bad."

It is hard to follow. However the homework and quizzes are easy because he gives you sample quizzes and many are online or take home. All in class quizzes are open book open note. he knows it is confusing and is very fair in grading

I spend more time in his office hours then I do in class and he is always very helpful but I wouldn\'t suggest taking the class if you can get another teacher. FYI the example quizzes he posts online tell you everything.

He tries to make accounting philosophical, which it clearly is not. I wish he would have just taught the material and skipped all the other BS. Not a really tough class, but if you want to be a CPA don\'t take him if you have a choice b/c you won\'t learn anything."

Weekly Hw-He posts the solutions on WebCT doesnt collect it but his teaching methods are..different..so since you have to teach yourself at least look over it..Few assignments that hes more than willing to help with really nice guy rambles a bit though..id say take him

Relates everything to accounting. Very up to date about the current economic crisis and is very intelligent. However, his teaching style for introduction to accounting can be confusing. He uses his own teaching methods which are totally different from your average t-accounts. I\'d say yes, take him!"
