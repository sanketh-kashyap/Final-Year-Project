Charles  Olmstead,Mount Saint Mary\'s University,Biology department, Los Angeles, CA,1,2.2,N/A,3.0,,3,12/15/2010,BIO50AL,1.5,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"EXTEMELY EASY CLASS! 3 TESTS (PRACTICAL STYLE). NEVER PAID ATTENTION, and still PASSED WITH an A. HIS LECTURES DO NOT HELP FOR THE TESTS. ask what chps will be on the test and study them in the book. look at models in class, he uses them on the tests. as long as your answer is close to the CORRECT answer, he will give you the points"

He practically reads materials right off of the textbook. At first, it seems like he is covering EVERYTHING in the book but pay attention to what he says during lecture. Things that he comments on WILL BE ON THE EXAM. Exam isn\'t too hard but the challenge is that there is A LOT TO MEMORIZE!"

Again, not surprising if you are a nursing major. TIPS: sit in the front because he speaks very very low; TAKE NOTES TAKE NOTES TAKE NOTES; communicate with him and maybe he\'ll reason with you; AND SHOW UP TO CLASS!!"
