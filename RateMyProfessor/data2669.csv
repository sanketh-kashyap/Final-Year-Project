She was a wonderful teacher and used a lot of case studies to demonstrate points. Her assignments were a fair ammount of work and kind of fun. There were a lot of extra credit opportunities.

I\'d highly recommend the class, interesting and she knows her stuff. Theres a test every week and they aren\'t very difficult and occasionally group. You need to read the text. Final exam was optional! Can be a bit tedious in class at times but was great overall."
