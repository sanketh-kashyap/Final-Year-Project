TOUGH GRADER,0,0,Lectures were super long and always cut them short due to time. Did not take the time to get to know students and seemed like he didn\'t care about how they did in the class. Only grades were tests. Gives a study guide but also says that there may be things that aren\'t on there on the test. I had like 60 pages of notes for each test to look over.

LECTURE HEAVY,0,0,"Took this class on a MWF schedule and he is used to TTh, so his lectures were cut short each day. He didn\'t post notes, and if you asked him to go back a slide he would be stressed and agitated. He also had online things you had to read and watch, including the book, which I didn\'t get. Lot of work for 200 level. I did really like the material."

He gives way too much work online and I bet that he would never get these lectures finished in an actual class hour. It was hard even interacting with him through emails.

Also he puts out a study guide, go through it with the book and your notes and you will get good a good grade."

He doesn\'t post notes, you just need to write/ type quickly. There is a lot of material, and at least 4-5 chapters are covered per test. The study groups are not helpful because the TA does them and she just reads the words of the study guide, and doesn\'t know the material."

Reading the textbook helps out a lot. The best thing is if you ask for help (or study group) he will try and have one put together. The tests can get hard if you don\'t study but he makes the information interesting. Just remember study!"
