He is a welcome change from the liberal viewpoint of most of the other faculty. Uses facts to put out his ideas not his feelings. I will take other courses with him as the instructor.

He is not, however a normal professor. He is not a liberal so if you are easily offended and can\'t handle a rational opinion, do not take this class. Instead go back to enjoying bong hits and marathon sessions of ultimate frisbee. It\'ll be ok because the government will just take care of you anyways."

If you get offended than I really would hate to see when you get into the real world. You learn in his class. Even if you don\'t agree he makes you think. I took him freshman year first class ever and I passed w no problem. I even learned something. Take his class its good.
