Hes a dork & knows it which is funny. Class is ALL lecture- if you pay close attention & take good notes youll be fine. Not the easiest grader but I managed to do well- he always gives detailed feedback. I\'d take his ethics class for sure."

You try to give an explanation of what the philosophers said and you get it wrong because it\'s not what Christ said. So you write what he says and you lose points for not copying. His handwriting is worse than a 2nd grader\'s and he doesn\'t answer questions well, he answers with something that doesn\'t make any sense."

He is a hard teacher, his writing sucks, hard to follow his notes, he has a bad attitude, he gets mad if you give a wrong answer. You can not think for yourself. Best advice if you take his class. Take really good notes and spit back what he says. good luck"
