Charles  Fosha,University of West Florida,Engineering department, Pensacola, FL,6,1.4,N/A,4.8,,9,04/22/2015,EEE4308L,1.0,5.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,,0,0,"Took him for EC1 Lab and had a horrible experience. Labs were outdated and many of the components used in the lab handout were not applicable to the software used to simulate in Multisim. VERY slow to return graded labs. On the plus side, he lets you redo labs for full credit. Was very lost & confused during labs. Could not even answer questions!!"

Overall, he ensures the student understands the material. Sometimes he is hard to keep up with in his theory but as long as you ask questions he will answer all of them thoroughly."

He not only insults the students he teaches, but he doesn\'t know how to teach his classes. Ugh... Dr. Rashid is pretty bad, but he\'s better than this guy!"

Without them almost all of us would have been lost. Fosha knows his stuff but has no clue how to instruct undergraduate level courses. No ill will against Dr. Fosha but I hope the department takes action to soon to find a new professor."

He doesnt teach he dictates and as others have stated he blames the students for his shortfalls. Hey Chuck,clue light,when the whole class is doing poorly its your fault! There is just too much bad to include. I will not take another class he teaches and suggest u do the same."

And when you fail, it is your fault and not because he has no clue how to teach (or write). Incomprehensible! Avoid this teacher!"

There is no organized flow to his teaching at all. His test have questions that come out of nowhere. Why he is allowed to teach still is beyond me. Two semesters of Fosha is to many, hopefully the engineering dept will do something soon. Charles you need to take your longeze and leave."
