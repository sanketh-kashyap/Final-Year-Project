One good thing was the paper. Throws tons of reading and questions at you, but no real teaching. You teach yourself. Posts had to be 3 or 7 sentences.

Lessons were very well organized and stuck to the textbook and the syllabus. The course was a lot of work but if you put in the effort you got a good grade. I recommend taking him you will learn a lot!

Clear, concise, helpful, open minded. He does not tell you what to think, but allows you to think on your own. History was no longer as boring as before for me. I would take him again.
