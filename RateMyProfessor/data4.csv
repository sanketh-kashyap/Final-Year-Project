RESPECTED  BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES,0,0,"Mr. Fresco was amazing for Bio 101 lecture/lab. He had a good sense of humor and did everything and anything for us to succeed throughout the term. He also somehow made sure that the entire class was really comfortable with each other, which helps out when you\'re in the lab setting. I would have to say he\'s my second favorite teacher at trident!"

I used to hate biology when I took it in high school. But he has made me love it so much now that I changed my major to it. He genuinely cares for his students and understands that sometimes you have stuff going on outside of school. Such a great person and teacher!

He is amazing and very helpful. His teaching is crystal clear and his passion for this subject is out of this world. I hope Trident and the world get more professors like him.

Vector breaks it down perfectly. his test comes from HIS notes but everything he teaches off his notes are on the final. He teaches his labs. The only down fall is that he only teaches at night 6 until 10 lab nights but we only stayed til ten maybe like five time if not less but he is AWESOME!!!

He actually wants you to learn and love the material. You get what you put in so if you don\'t study and you don\'t go to class, you surely wont pass. However, if something comes up he is always willing to work with you. one of my favorite teachers! Actually teaches"

I went in with a bad attitude but he was so motivating and positive he changed my attitude around. I learned a lot more from him then the first time I took the course. He prepared us so well for the final I made an A without studying.

He encouraged me to go on and get my 4 year degree in biology even though my intention was nursing. He doesn\'t like abscences but understands and makes you find other means if you miss class and there aren\'t makeup quizes.
