She\'s caring and tries to make you feel confident. It IS a workout though. Don\'t come thinking it\'s an easy A. You gotta show up and actually participate. There\'s a former professional dancer in my class she works up a sweat and you will too. That said, it\'s SO much fun! I highly recommend it."

She is unorganized, scattered in thoughts and choosy. Although the class was easy and she was nice, it\'s easy for you to do wrong on an assignment and earn less points. This is only because she Doesn\'t explain assignments thoroughly. I chose to drop the course for these reasons."
