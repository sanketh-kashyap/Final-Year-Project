She gives plenty of extra credits to make up missing points. The class is not difficult if you put effort into the reading and assigned materials.

Disorganized!

She only reads her lecture through her computer and not really lecture. Her quizzes and tests were hard and had a lot of wrong ""correct"" answers on the online quiz. Too bad we can\'t see the answers to the midterms and finals. Who knows what kind of wrong answers were in the"

For students, she offers a challenging courseload (Midterm Avg 69) balanced with opportunities for extra credit - all of which require dedication to complete. She encourages open dialogue, and it is impressive to me that a community college retains such a high caliber individual"

I feel you are very grounded and knowledgeable of the information that was required of us. I also enjoyed the many side bars because real life made a connection with the book. Thank you and good luck to you with your education.

You just have to make sure to read the book before taking the quizzes, and take detailed notes for the exams (including the tables in the book). She gives plenty of extra credit opportunities to make up for the hard tests and quizzes. If you take her, expect to spend about 5-7 hours a week studying for her class."

Prof. Griswold made it interesting. She also encouraged lively discussions in the class. I would take another class where she is the professor in a heart beat!"

Our midterm\'s class average was 69 (D). Her online quizzes are very hard too. She seems to be generous with grading ITV video discussions. Overall, I would not recommend this instructor."

However, her tests are very hard. Tests had allot of detailed questions from book\'s tables and charts. She gives opportunities to earn extra credit. Yet, she is much harder then other ITV instructors. You might want to take this class through LACC - I heard that they have better Psych 41 instructors."
