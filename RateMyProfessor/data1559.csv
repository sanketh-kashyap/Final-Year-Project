Do not take it if you are just looking for an easy A. The tests are on 14 chapters and you\'re expected to study the book and PP for each. The assignments each week are easy, the tests are just near impossible. Likely going to be my first C in college. Also, buy the book. The tests are only about half from the PPs."

It\'s really a simple class."

You don\'t actually have to learn anything or show up. If you do attend class, he gives you all of the questions that will be on the test. You watch a lot of Anthony Bordain clips from No Reservations."

Makes class so fun doesnt feel like class at all. He was very understanding when I had \'printer issues\' and let me email all my stuff to him. I\'m taking another class with him next semester just because its him.

That\'s why he brings in outside lectures like wine companies. LOVED HIM will take other classes with HIM!!!
