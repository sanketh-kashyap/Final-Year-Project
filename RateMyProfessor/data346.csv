There is usually a quiz at the start of each class. (even the day after an exam.) He also follows the textbook very closely. he is a nice guy, but he moves a little too fast and doesn\'t offer very in depth explanations. He will simply bombard you with difficult examples."

In exam if you don\'t understand, you better ask him. I didn\'t ask him during exam or in class so I did very bad. Lucky exam is open book and you gotta review the topic before the exam. Otherwise you will end up flipping pages all around."
