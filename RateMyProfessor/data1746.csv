Her class is a complete waste of time. They are letting anyone become teachers now-a-days. Please don\'t take her.

She is a mad scientist! She knows her stuff, but somehow can\'t connect to the students! The whole class is lost. EXTREMELY HARD! She makes up by giving impossible take home quizzes and open book tests, however, THEY R HARD! And she speaks EXTRMELY low! Can\'t way to be outta there. But I like her as a person!"

She doesn\'t know how to teach and just points at a power point and expects you to learn. Spends more then half the class trying to figure out how to use the projector. Talks VERY LOW.
