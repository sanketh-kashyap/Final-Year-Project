Harry  Collis,College of San Mateo,Foreign Languages department, San Mateo, CA,3,5.0,N/A,1.5,,4,04/02/2012,SPAN111,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"He\'s extremely easy, lets you make up tests in which you get lower than a C. That being said, it\'s a struggle to go to class. He spends a lot of time taking roll and be prepared to hear him speak different languages and brag about how smart he is. Oh, he also calls himself ""daddy."" If you can, take Spanish with someone else or at Canada."

I learned much more in this class than in SPAN 110, even though we got barely any homework - because Collis was really passionate about teaching and encouraged everyone to speak Spanish in the classroom. Also gave great pointers on minimizing accent. Hidden treasure at CSM."

I can honestly say that Harry is the BEST teacher ever! He really understands what he\'s teaching and really cares about the students sucess in Spanish. Highly recommend!"

Harry really tries hard to make sure each student does his or her best and has a good time doing it. He works hard in getting you to speak like a native Spanish speaker. By far, the best Spanish teacher at CSM. Don\'t waste time on the others.Been there."
