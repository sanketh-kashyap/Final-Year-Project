Kenneth  Abbott,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,1,3.1,N/A,3.8,,6,05/14/2011,POS394,4.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Abbott has been a life-changing professor for my studies at ASU. His lectures teach you that you will not always have someone holding your hand, and you must pay attention to truly grasp the topic, but this should be expected of college students. Highly recommend taking any course taught by Abbott, he is great."

Gives no direction for our paper nor the midterm and will not return our papers because he is ""too busy."" When we ask questions, he makes you feel dumb for asking. Very disorganized lecture and difficult to follow, terrible handwriting (he only used the whiteboard)."

He teaches on slides which he later post on bb. The problem i have with him is that he doesnt clearly say what he expects. He gives u the midterm with no study guide or expectations. Their is no other test except for the final which he elaborates more on.

He can also be very arrogant. Generally a good prof though."
