The only thing I regret is that she will not teach next semester :-(. She makes the class interesting, her lectures are not boring at all. Her test are easy and base on her lectures , and the assigment she give are easy as well and fun to do it. My grade for her is a A+++++++ definitely I recommend her."

She explains and puts into the prospective a lot of previously unnoticed but important things. Fun assignments and final presentation was a blast. She uses a lot of on-line resources and has all lectures with powerpoint slides online. Would love to take another class with her. P.S. we all dressed up for the class :)

Not only are her lectures fun so are all her assignments! This is the only class I looked forward to during the week. Any class she teaches I want to take!
