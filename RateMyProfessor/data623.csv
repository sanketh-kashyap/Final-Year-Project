Cleo A.  Hughes-Darden,Morgan State University,Biology department, Baltimore, MD,6,1.5,N/A,4.3,,3,05/07/2015,BIO310,1.0,5.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,2,"She is not helpful at all, I learned nothing in this class although I passed it was only through help of our TA and others who have taken the class before. She talks through the slides, study them to gain tour own understanding she makes everything seem very hard. She is also boring."

Also, The way she taught nobody retained the information because she taught it as if it were hard concepts to grasp, so thats the frame of mind everyone was in but had she taught as if it were something simple then everyone would have received it as such."

She is used to teaching Bio majors that are atleast juniors so she expects non-majors to have the same enthusiam.
