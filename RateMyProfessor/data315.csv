First of all she gives 5 test which seems crazy but it actually means if u get the grade u want on 4 of the test and turn in the hw your done with the class by the beginning of nov and can skip the 5th test. Tes super easy tells u everything u need to know question by question on review day. Gives answers to hw online b4 due. Easy A+
