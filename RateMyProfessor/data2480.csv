He knows so much about policies and after you leave his class you do too. Absolutely one of the best teacher and course had at Governors State University!!! He teaches so much you leave an expert about policies and bureaucratic b.s.. If you see his name take him you will not regret it.

Forget the easy party. His lectures are clear & simple to comprehend. You can actually take notes to his lectures which you will need for the take home exams & not only did I learn what I required for the class but I learned about rights I never had and have actually used them. Take him if you can, his classes fill up fast."
