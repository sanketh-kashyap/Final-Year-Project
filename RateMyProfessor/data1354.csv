His style of teaching is very interactive, associative, and spontaneous, because he is trying to free up our minds and help us explore new ways of thought. Students should not expect to do well simply by studying and reading, but by allowing the class to actively engage with their lives."

In lectures, he rambles on and only gives you half of the picture and expects you to paint the rest. He tests you on the stuff he hasn\'t mentioned. Also, hands out study guides which is cool, but only 40% of the stuff that\'s on the study guides is on the test! He is confusing and the readings are L O N G and quizzes suck."

There are long 50 page readings due every class. The readings are dense, boring, and tedious. If you dont read though, you may fail a quiz. Way too much work and such a boring abstract subject that he does not do an excellent job in explaining. Great guy tho"

He is very bad at lecturing and getting his points across. He rambles on and on and in the end gets nowhere. Do not take this class if you\'re expecting an easy GE. He also has a bad temper and one lecture ended in him cussing us out and then storming out of the room. Do not take him

But he really knows the material and is extremely helpful and patient during OH. There are 2 essays, 1 midterm, and a final along with weekly assignments. Not a typical lecture. More like a big discussion. Material is interesting, but can get really hard. Just ask him, and no need to read all required readings!"

He is so nice and his class is super interesting. It is very difficult and you have to do the reading but it\'s totally worth it. I loved this class. I would recommend him to anyone.

You really have to think out of the box for this course. He is very passionate about religion. He challenged me to think in different ways. This is a demanding class. 3 Midterms no Final. Sections attendance is mandatory. Lectures are IMPORTANT. You need to read some readings because there are small quizzes.

Go to the lectures and pay close attention so you don\'t have to do the readings and it makes the tests/papers super easy. A 10 minute hw assignment every week.

Each religion has its own midterm. None of the midterms are cumulative and there is no final. The quizzes killed me. Even when you do the reading they are still confusing and difficult. The midterms weren\'t bad. With minor studying you can get a B. Study alot and you\'ll get an A. Class/section is basically mandatory

Pretty cool/approachable guy, spends a lot of time on ensuring students understand the concepts he\'s trying to teach. Go to class and pay attention, and you\'ll be fine. The reading isn\'t strictly mandatory, but it helps. Goes over modern biases we have, tries to bring awareness to students."

He\'s very down-to-earth and funny. Exams weren\'t bad at all. I\'d never had any experience with the subject matter, but he made everything clear in lecture. A word of advice if you\'re taking him: The reading is not always necessary, Got an A- in this class with no prior knowledge, & watch out for pop quizzes."

He focuses on unraveling modern biases within students, so that concepts that may seem easy are completely deconstructed and rebuilt.

Interesting lectures if a bit scattered. The kind of guy you\'d want to discuss with at length. DO THE READING.

He\'s really helpful if you have any questions and go to office hours. You can think about the concepts to the point that it actually hurts you\'re grade rather than helps it though.

Lots of outside reading that you get quizzed on. Warning: only take this class if you are READY TO THINK, because it forces you to do that a lot. Going to lecture is necessary, and discussion helps a lot."
