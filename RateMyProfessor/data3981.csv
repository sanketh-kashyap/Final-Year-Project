But her lectures are not good, she hardly tells you any relevant information, and she is really rude. Like really rude. I didn\'t learn anything in her class, I learned all relevant info from other teachers. She should stick to administrative duties."

The entire class STILL does not know their grades for both of her classes. She has not given us our grades ONCE this sem, because shes too ""busy"" to update our grades for us. She talks down on students making them feel dumb sometimes. My least favorite teacher in the program"

Ask a question & she doesnt answer it. Talks a lot about herself & goes off topic a lot. Kind of unorganized & doesnt let you know your grade for more than half the semester
