Karrin  Klotz,University of Washington,Business department, Bothell, WA,5,3.6,N/A,2.0,,8,03/14/2014,BCUSP202,4.5,1.0,Not Mandatory,N/A,N/A,A-,,1,0,Decent. Shes really sweet and kind. Curves tests. Can be pretty funny at times and tries to make class interesting. I thought this was going to be a hard class but it ended up not being bad at all. Pay attention in class and do the readings a little and you will pass with a good grade.

They were relatively easy, but she grades too hard on participation. I got a 4.0, 3.8, 3.5, and 3.5 for the midterms, final, and paper. But gave me a 1.0 in participation. Even though I went to every class and contributed in discussions and did the group exercises. Ended up with a 3.2, which was not what I expected"

Her introduction to law class was so enjoyable! She always defines terms in ways that make them easy to understand, such as using real world examples. She has a great sense of humor and her lectures are rarely dry, as she finds ways to keep them funny and interesting. I feel like I learned a lot and earned the A I received."

All she does is lecture and its very monotone and boring. Had a hard time focusing and her review sheet for the final has nothing to do with what is on the final.

Very little discussed in class was found on tests. Spent lots of time watching left-wing movies bashing all companies. Made us buy a $40 course pack that contained nothing but printouts of articles freely available online from a store that does not allow refunds. Worst teacher!"
