Tried to relate to the students and was pretty funny at times. Taught clearly and didn\'t do any ""trick questions"" on the exam. Is a newbie, but definitely not incompetent."

Great potential, he was just really scared! ya I thought he was HOT haha *(much better then my Psych 104 prof as far as exams go)*"

Lots of work with him, since his notes don\'t follow the textbook, yet you\'re still expected to know both very well for exams. Clarifies course content, so pretty good for a first year prof"

Simply read off and added some side comments to his powerpoint slides, but it wasn\'t too boring; I managed to stay awake even though I fell asleep in my other classes. Explanations are for the most part clear, understandable."

Yeah he just reads off his notes, I think he could be a decent prof he just has to do his homework and do more preparation before lecturing! His exams were difficult considering its 1st year, and the class wasnt supposed to be curved, but I think he curved it in the end, or I would not have ended up with a B+ after getting 60 on final"

His notes are scripted, his exams are too difficult for the level that he is teaching at, he focuses too much on his interests and not the subject matter. Brings in a lot of guest speakers for things he \'didn\'t know so well\'. There were a lot of them. Lied to us on a midterm. Do NOT take his class."

In reality, he is a terrible prof that does not engage his students and simply read from a script which isn\'t always the same as the provided notes. Avoid if possible, if not read the textbook religiously."

First time prof as other people have stated but I personally don\'t harbor any hopes that he\'ll get much better. If you enjoy reading the text and skipping class go right ahead.

(our average was 60-something...)"

He has potential, I think, if he would learn to stop directly reading off his notes and just teach! I guess he atleast tries to make things interesting, and doesn\'t agree with the curve which is nice."

Appears as though his lectures are scripted. Notes are available in full powerpoint format and his lecture deviates very little from these. Low incentive to attend class. First exam was easy, but must read the text."
