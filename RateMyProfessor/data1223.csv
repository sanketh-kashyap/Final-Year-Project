Yvan  Bousquet,Universite du Quebec a Montreal,Law department, Montreal, QC,0,4.5,N/A,1.0,,1,01/29/2009,JUR6615,4.5,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Very nice and helpful teacher. He takes time to reply to e-mail and answers all the students\' questions before and after class. He\'s a very good teacher, but he sometimes goes from one subject to another and it\'s hard to keep track. But as soon as someone says he\'s lost, he goes back and tries to get it clearer. Recommended!"
