Homework takes days, and is handed out weekly. The tests do assess the material though. Hicks is a great professor, but he will go thru material fast. MAKE FRIENDS & DO HMWK TOGETHER!!!"

LOTS OF HOMEWORK  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"I enrolled in this class because I enjoyed my last statistics class and I am good at math. This class is heavily based in theory. I have never worked so hard in a class, took me days to do homework. Tests are tricky and will combine multiple concepts. He lectures in a technical way and it is very easy to get lost. Study guides are very broad."

You have to really read the textbook because many concepts from the textbook and not from the lecture will appear on the exam. He grades fairly and gives extra credit. He\'s really clear when he lectures and allows for discussion if needed."

I made an A but it wasn\'t achieved easily. He is very picky about the information he wants you to know and is a tough grader. It\'s not impossible to make an A in his class (because he has HUGE curves) but you have to work very hard. Still learned a lot though.

The quizzes were so hard and given weekly. Thats what killed my grade. But, I went to every class and studied but I didnt realize how hard the first test would be and got a 62. the rest of mine were C\'s but my final grade was a 69 and I needed a 69.5 and he did not give it 2 me."
