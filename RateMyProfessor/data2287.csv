She truly does want the best for her students. She is extremely knowledgable and just an overall wonderful person. The only thing is that she is a little monotone.. And her quizzes are hard as heck. But I would probably take her again, if needed."

Her quizzes, however, are tough. It seems as if she pulls most of the questions out of thin air, not related to what was discussed in class. Or topics she barely mentions is a huge focus on the quiz, whereas some of the material you would think would be on the queiz is not."
