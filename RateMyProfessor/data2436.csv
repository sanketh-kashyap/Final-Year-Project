She\'s an awesome metic and very knowledgeable but I don\'t think she knows how to teach the material again if you can\'t study 25/7 and know how to teach your self then DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!

She uses her phone to communicate with other students etc. If you are in a class like this you should be able to teach yourself. Read your book and learn something, it is not her job to baby you. Great teacher, great person."

She never has bad days and she does not bring her attitude to the classroom. On the other hand, she assigns a ton of homework and wordlists that can be used on the tests. The only problem with that is she does not give you the answers to check your work. Overall on a scale of 1-10, I would give her a 7."

Be prepared to learn on your own, even if asked for help from student she still kinda gets outta helping... she keeps her phone on during class and well litaraly sit there in the middle of a powerpoint lecture in which she just reads word for word and pause to text somebody back who text her or pick up the pho"

Class is generally easy but if you can\'t teach yourself very well find another teacher fast!"

Most take her for EMT- Basic
