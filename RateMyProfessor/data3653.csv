As far as teaching in class he\'s meh, little boring and hard to follow. But his hard copy examples are crystal clear. It\'s college you have to teach yourself sometimes. He is the nicest guy ever, you will not fail if you make an honest effort. He\'s more helpful out of class, and will take the time to talk 1-1."

He procrastinates with grades and then rushes to grade everything resulting in many mistakes. Afterward when you go to have him fix it is refuses to.

I\'m smarter and know more about AutoCAD than him. I\'ve found his errors on homework and exams. He is very picky on grading. i.e. if the text is readable on the drawing but it is just not large enough because he thinks so, he would take points off. If you work hard this class, you will be ok."

But you can figure out what he says. Read the notes he posts online, show up and do your homework you\'ll get an A or B. Also if you are struggling he is so happy to help, you just have to come to him."
