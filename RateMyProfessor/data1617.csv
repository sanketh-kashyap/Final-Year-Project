YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,Chris was the perfect first semester professor. She made me feel extremely comfortable in class and really showed how much she cares about her students in more ways than one. Her tests are hard but its nursing school so that is to be expected! Only complaint is that her grading strategy changed with every student. Overall extremely helpful though!

She is caring & wants to see her students succeed. She makes sure you know she\'s the boss when it comes to reasoning for answers on exams. Only downfall is she sends out too many emails. That was annoying, but she wants you to ask for help."

TOUGH GRADER,2,0,"Chris is always available either by email or office hours. Just don\'t except motivation or pep talks from her. She\'s a tough grader and hardly ever, ever wrong. She doesn\'t like when you call her out on anything, You\'ll be in the wrong. She says she\'s not trying to trick you, but she sometimes seems too. But it is what it is ;)"
