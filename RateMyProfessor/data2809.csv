The short answers are based on additional articles and course content but they aren\'t worth that much and he explicitly tells you in class what to focus on. He is helpful if you seek help."

He\'s witty, energetic, and clearly loves what he does. His teaching style on the other hand is something else. Cognitive Neuroscience is not something that is easy to understand for everyone, yet this man just pours out all of the information in a torrential flow without stopping to let you absorb what was said."
