There is about the same amount of homework that I received in my high school math classes. She is really helpful if you go to her for help. She will spend all class going over homework if it is needed. The class is hard, though."

Being someone who isn\'t awful but not great at math she isn\'t very helpful. She told me if I worked hard she would give me the grade I deserved. Did that happen, no. If you can, avoid her at all costs. Lots of homework. Doesn\'t seem to care about her students"
