She also doesn\'t give you the rubric until a couple days your essay is due. She graded really tough on the first essay. We did this poster assignment that really didn\'t need to happen and it just took time from an essay that was due soon. TAKE ANOTHER.

I try so hard not to fall asleep in class, and if you do she won\'t care. NO clarity what so ever, she just repeats herself though out class and you never really know what exactly it is she wants you to do. Just show up and she will give you points for the daily activity.

Papers say we will cover certain topics listed in class and we almost never do. Lots of reading and YOU MUST BE THERE. Grading is heavily based on attendance and papers pack a punch. Do not recommend due to issues with clarity."

Talks the whole lesson but doesn\'t seem to get anything across. VERY unclear as to what she wants. I felt ENG101 was more compehensive the her class.

It is so hard to sit through her class because she explains things for an hour that could take 5 minutes.

She wants you not only to pass but to learn. It can be hard to focus in some of her classes because she tends to lecture and have days with little student participation. Overall a really nice lady and good teacher.

Comp II. Nice lady. Actually a really good class, and assignments/projects are good too. Only real problem was first half of class is always confusing - don\'t know what you\'re doing. A little more organization would be better. She\'s a sweetheart though. Nice to see in a teacher!"
