Lecture may be boring at times but he will help you if you dont understand. Curves grades..so take it with him. Attendance is mandatory because you have to turn in homeworks... Easy A or B.

Test involve very little math, 80% of them are all conceptual qs. Easier to learn by reading the book than from his lecture. However he bends backward in grading curve. Curves tests, gives ExCr, and highest test is 40% of grade and lowest is 10%. IfYouGetOneAURSet."
