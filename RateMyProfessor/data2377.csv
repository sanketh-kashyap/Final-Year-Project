I didn\'t feel like I learned ANYTHING about English or how to be a better writer. He is very laid back and flexible and if you go in to his office hours he gives good feedback, but I don\'t find his expectations for writing very clear. He can be pretty critical."

He explains clearly what he expects from students and he iss avaible when needed. I enjoyed going to his class and I cracked a smile every class. He is symphatheic and I reccommend him as a teacher, he aims to help students become a better writer"

Simply put this class could have been very interesting and inviting, yet it is just annoying to go to. He wants it to be engaging yet he takes the reins as he babbles on forever with often boring run-ons. He makes no sense and grades hard. Class is boring the 1st quiz is a pop quiz.blah"

He\'s so funny and really tries to engage the class. I love the books we\'re reading and the films we watch. His comments on my papers are SO helpful. I\'m definitely learning a lot in his class!
