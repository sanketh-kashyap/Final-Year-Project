Janis  Langins,University of Toronto - St. George Campus,Humanities department, Toronto, ON,2,4.2,N/A,3.7,,3,09/20/2011,HPS202,2.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"This was the absolute worst teacher I have had in University. He spoke down to his students, he was boring, he lacked any social skill what-so-ever, and his readings were ridiculous. Clawing your eyes out would be less painful than sitting through a year in his class."

Highly recommend this professor.

He posts lecture outlines on Blackboard in advance of the class, and is almost always perfectly on point. He has a wide breadth off knowledge not limited to engineering or history of technology. I\'ve taken two of his classes, and I would highly recommend him."
