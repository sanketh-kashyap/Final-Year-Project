Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department, Boston, MA,2,3.0,N/A,3.5,,12,10/17/2011,PS241,2.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I hope you can write/type fast as you\'ll need to be able to do that to keep up. She covers an entire 1.5 hour lecture in 40-50mins on average (some times only 30 mins) by talking at the speed of light. Also English isn\'t her first language which makings things trickier. It does show up on her poorly worded exams and she is stick about grade cut off

It\'s all about pointless baby facts that aren\'t very applicable. Exams are COMPLETELY based on the lectures. What you get on the exams is what you get in the class, which sucks bc the ques are unclear. **Final MC ques are EXACTLY the ques on past 3 exams so review the exams!"

Not clear in explaining some of the concepts and moves extremely fast and let out class early every single time. Discussions are usually question-answer base, which wasn\'t really useful, but there\'s an attendance. I don\'t recommend her - try another class!"

She is very enthusiastic about research and she was clearly knowledgeable about current research. Lectures had just the right amount of information and they were clear, had good slides and great videos. You will enjoy this course if you are interested in babies and how they develop."

Book is useful but lectures are most important. She knows the material really well and asks questions to make sure people got it. I also enjoyed the videos she showed in class. I strongly recommend it.

She\'s misleading and unclear with some of the concepts so be sure to read the books (or at least skim!). Discussions were not helpful at all! I Wouldn\'t recommend her.

Be prepared to take 90 mins worth of notes in 45-60 mins. We got out of lecture 30-45 mins early every time. She also has no knowledge of basic biology so she gives misleading information during the human development section. Additionally her exams are poorly written and many questions don\'t make sense.

I really enjoyed her class and she was clearly knowledgeable about the material and enthusiastic about increasing students\' interest levels. Very nice! She has high expectations but is always available and willing to help. Take this course if you like babies and amazing professors! <3

Lectures do have stuff that\'s not in the textbook so it\'s good to go. She also shows short video clips with studies. I found it easier to go through the textbook after lecture. nice teacher.

She is very excited about research and she wants students to really understand the material. The tests are tricky but if you attend class and read textbook you\'ll be fine. I learned a lot in this class.

She pretty much copies the book in her powerpoints, she reads off of her powerpoints and isn\'t very clear. She does not give review sheets for exams. She drops the lowest test grade and has a very generous scale. However, the questions on the exams are worded oddly. I wouldn\'t recommend her."
