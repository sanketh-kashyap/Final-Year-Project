If math is not your strong point; take his class and you will learn.

Tests weekly: also for your own good. Can be a little out there, but is excellent at explaining what needs to be explained. Tests often are on text material and not lecture, you should definitely use the book."

He makes the class interesting and always stays a little longer if you have any questions and will work out any problems in homework. Homework in mandatory but he does not check it. He quizzes every week which is amazing because you don\'t have any tests. He makes the class interesting and he is very nice.

Whenever she had problems getting her words out he said, "" I answer questions, not comments."" Make sure you know what you want to ask before you raise your hand to avoid hearing that belittling statement at all costs."
