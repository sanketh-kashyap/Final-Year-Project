I had her for Ways of Reading, and she managed to teach us all these hard literary theories and make it easy to understand. She genuinely cares about you as a person, and was quick to respond to any emails or clarify things for you. The class was partially online so you could miss one and not miss out!"

I took this class because it was online through VIU, but didn\'t know she works at the Cowichan campus. She required both exams to be written in Cowichan, or you had to pay extra for assessment services at VIU. Rip off."

She was quite ignorant through online text and very unclear. Also, as a first year course, I half-expected her to explain and remind students of certain assignments. Very little instruction and zero reminder for anything. No good."

Sally is such a good teacher and respects her students. She always wants to hear your opinion and gives helpful feedback so you can make the most of this eng class.

She is very understanding and works with the students. I also enjoy the homework she gives. She does not make you do anything that will not be helpful to the learning outcomes of the class. Her class is well organized and offers lots of additional help outside of class. I recommended this teacher.
