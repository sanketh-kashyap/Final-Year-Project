I\'m not great at math and she helped me through any problems I was having. She\'s a kind person and I really enjoyed her class.

I hated math before her, but now I have a new found respect for it. If given the opportunity, TAKE HER. 2 midterms, 1 final, and an easy group project. I found it very manageable. You will have weekly homework as well, which was the hardest part."
