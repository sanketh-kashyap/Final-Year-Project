Literally lectures the whole time youre in class and its so boring. She teaches you useless information and gives you terms to study for the test to help but, none of them are on the actual test!! She gives you no guidance on how to complete assignments either."

If humanities isn\'t your forte, you may be somewhat bored. However, she is extremely knowledgeable of the subject and is willing to help all of her students - all you need to do is ask. For any info missed in class, the textbook pretty much covered it all."

This class is a brutal fight to stay awake. I love Greek mythology but after this class, I hate it. She talks for an hour without any class participation. No group assignments. She gives a review before the test but doesn\'t follow her own review which misleads the student into studying the wrong topics. Don\'t take her."
