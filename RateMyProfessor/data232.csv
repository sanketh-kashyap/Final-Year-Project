DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE."

He spends too much time pacing and walking around, making it hard to pay attention. Must must must read the textbook, because class alone will not be enough. Smart man, but should not be teaching."

Normack spends his time walking up and down the isles searching for someone to call out if he thinks they are using their phones or laptops for non class-related activities. For this reason he is useless. I\'m paying money to be taught and he spends his time rambling instead of teaching.

He spends all of his class time looking for people texting as opposed to teaching and rants on about the most irrelevant garbage. If he put half the effort he puts into catching people texting into teaching, he\'d probably be substantially better."

The exams are impossible, and the students don\'t know whats going on. It seems like he is in his own little word when he speaks. A total loony."
