It would have been nice if he was more willing to help students outside of class though. Other than that the department final is horrible, but there is a curve."

His explanations are very clear and easy. He makes hard material look easy. He will explain new material to you until you understand it. He gives 3 in-class tests that are based on final exams from previous semester and 10 quizes during the semester. Tests are challenging, but the quizes are very easy. You als"

The tests are hard, of course, but he does a great job explaining the complicated material. The book is not mandatory and is not used in class. Personally though I needed the book to study. It helped me do better on the tests."

U basically MUST pass the math final and do your homeworks; and do the weekly quizzzes. My three test grades were 70 and below; and still got a C. He\'ll get u through it so for people coming out of MTH 1030 take him!

Teaches the material in a slow pace and explains it well. Answers HW questions daily. Quiz once a week and sometimes allows class to go over quizes with each other. HW/Quizes @ 8% each, 3 exams @ 17% each, Final @ 33%. Wish he taught MTH 2205 for the summer or fall semester!"

He responds to emails promptly. My first semester at Baruch was great because he was my professor. You cannot get any better then him i just hoped he taught 2205 would be first to sign up.
