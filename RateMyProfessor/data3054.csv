His class is well-organized and he is always prepared for any questions/concerns. He adds humor to the classroom, which is a bonus to creating a fun environment. In terms of his workload, to put it simply: read, research, write, and repeat."

He tries his best to help his students succeed in class. If you read all the assigned readings on time, you\'ll get an easy A. However, prepare yourself for group projects. I got an A- because my group couldn\'t collaborate well and were lazy in completing their assigned work."

Contrary to most reviewers Lindsy is a guy, by the way. He offered about 20 points of extra credit to our class, so that was awesome. He has very clear guidelines and expectations for class assignments and even posted some examples. Exams should be studied for, but aren\'t too difficult. Would take his class again."

She kept it interesting & entertaining & genuinely seemed to care about her students. She is very straight forward with her expectations & extremely helpful. I cannot talk her up enough.

Lindsey is quite knowledgeable and friendly. 2 multiple choice exams, 6 in class assignments, 2 short response papers.

Honestly, if you printed out the powerpoints, you didn\'t need to do the course reading because she went over it all in lecture. She\'s funny and intelligent. As some people mentioned, she does read off her slides, she also can answer any question that she\'s asked. Plenty of opportunity for extra credit."

Her powerpoints are very straightforward and her expectations are as well. Personable lecturer and her assignments are pretty easy. Reading for most classes but she goes over them in detail during class so I haven\'t done much of it at all and got a 96% on the midterm. Overall great!

She drives home all of the things she expects you to know in class. She is felxible about many things, you just have to talk to her, and yes she does respond to emails. She may mumble from time to time, but I would definitely recommend her"

She has a good sense of humor, too."
