As an SGI (the cult which founded Soka university) leading member, he expanded his teaching to Humanities. SGI students can thereby take multiple courses with him. Good listener, aware of his responsibilities, he expects students to transcend their teachers. Highly recommended to foreign and Japanese students."

He willingly gives advice in matters outside of his academic class!"
