I would love to take more of her classes but she only teaches a few. She is also the Fieldwork person so I know that I can contact her for future volunteer postitions. I encourage everyone to take her.

TEST HEAVY,1,0,"In all my college life, I have never felt so belittled and disregarded by anow educator. Professor Robles-Nichols belittled me in a group email, accused me of things I didn\'t do, and put my concerns on the backburner. I know she\'s a beloved instructor in the CBS department, but she is the reason I regret ever choosing this minor. Good luck with her"

This class should be a simple class, however the way Robles teaches it is extemely ridiculous. Her tests are the most frustrating tests I\'ve ever taken in my life. They are wordy, tricky and confusing. The powerpoints are a mess & she just reads off of them. Just don\'t do it."
