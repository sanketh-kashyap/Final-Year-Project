Allan  Learst,Northern Michigan University,English department, Marquette, MI,4,3.2,N/A,1.7,,3,05/27/2013,EN111,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I did not care for Dr. Learst one bit. I had him a few years ago. (Fall 2008) Useful material was sparse between his normal lectures that featured nonsense and goofing off. Dr. Learst is a shining example of a professor with his head up his rear-end. Everything is about him and the character he plays in class - not about the students.

He does have a really hard policy on assignments, though... everything must be turned in, and it must be on time, or you fail automatically. I certainly respect the need to do hard work, but I think an automatic F for 5 questions a day late is dumb"
