He\'s a horrible teacher. I\'m still in the class, and it\'s just horribly unbearable to be in this class. He\'s an incompetent teacher, he confuses himself (which then confuses students), and his tests are difficult. The only to pass the class is to read the book. I hate this teacher. He belongs in a home."

He never explains fully any of the work he shows on the board nor does he finish the problems he starts. His notes have a lot of mistakes which is confusing. He constantly claims his tests are easy as long as you make a ""free body diagram"" yet the class averages on tests are 50% or below."
