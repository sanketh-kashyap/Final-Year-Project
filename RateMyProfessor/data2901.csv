Ritchie  Bryant,Sacramento City College,Sign Language department, Sacramento, CA,1,4.3,N/A,3.3,,3,02/04/2010,ASL100,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"A class for those who really care about learning ASL, not who are just looking for easy credits. Prof Bryant was funny, clever and patient. A wonderful teacher who obviously cares about his students and the subject. It was great to learn ASL from a deaf person. You will also learn about deaf culture and be forced to attend local social events."

He definately kept you interested in the class. The class is something that you need to show up for since it is a visual learning class. He is helpful and is willing to answer your questions but if you have no patience for dealing with a deaf professor, go somewhere else. Overall, his class was awesome!"
