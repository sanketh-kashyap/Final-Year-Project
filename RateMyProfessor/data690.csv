Her class isn\'t that difficult, study your lecture notes and you\'ll do just fine. She tells you what will be on the test and she likes to give bonus points. She even gives bonus points if you attend class! She makes her class interesting and fun, so I recommend everyone to take her."

You have two research assignments that are pretty simple and she grades fairly. She is energetic and gives a lot of examples."
