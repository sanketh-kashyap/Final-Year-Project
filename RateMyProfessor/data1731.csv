Disregard any negative reviews about her, I can\'t imagine how anyone couldn\'t love this lady. Her accent is sexy. She\'s hilarious and extremely friendly. I HATED math before this class. Breaks it down Barney-style. She taught me so, so much. Wonderful teacher and a joy to look at. ;)"

She does have an accent that takes time getting use to, but she is very funny during class. She does assign homework every night. Her tests and quizzes are very easy as long as you do the homework and print out her notes to follow along with the lectures. Her lectures tend to get boring, but hey..it\'s math."

Although she offers ""office hours"" for tutoring, she does not follow through. She does not thoroughly explain concepts, yet expects you to learn them overnight for a quiz. If you have a difficult time with math, don\'t take her. She will only leave you more confused than when you began."
