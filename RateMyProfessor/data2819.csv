Prof. Weinroth is a terrible professor; her lectures are completely and totally disorganized, boring and overall lacking any sort of substance. I\'m a 4.0 student and got an A- in this class despite doing an obscene amount of work! She is VERY unclear about her requirements - impossible to get an A"

Pretty much knows everything about art and history. She\'ll take you to really fun events, and all you have to do is write three reviews, blog entries, and do a group project at the end. Will help you with reviews if you have trouble."

The class is an easy A, the only requirements really are attendance and blog entries, as opposed to other teachers who make you write a 10 page paper at the end. She\'s very disorganized and unclear about some of the assignments."

Granted I am biased in liking the arts very much but I feel like she is a genuinely brilliant and intellectual person and has much to offer to her students. She may not be the best organized Professor but she radiates intellect, you can learn much from her."

She is also very willing to help you and answer any and every question that you may have. Orna is YAFEH MEOD!! I HIGHLY recommend her as a teacher!!"
