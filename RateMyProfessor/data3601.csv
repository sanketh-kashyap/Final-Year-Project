He leaves it up to you to figure out the lesson and its pretty much a self taught class because he doesn\'t teach you at all. If your not very good at math DONT TAKE THIS CLASS or you won\'t do well!

He is a student teacher & it shows. The only way I made an A is because my boyfriend is an engineering major and is super smart!
