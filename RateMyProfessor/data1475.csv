If you dare challenge her on anything she says she will pretty much hate you from there on. She did not follow the curriculum like the rest of the professors and I learned almost nothing from the class. She was often late and had things back to us late as well. Do not take her."

She\'s rude, she\'s confrontational, she\'s arrogant. Don\'t be late to class or sit out of your ""assigned seat""- which everyone is sitting on top of each other. She will call you and makes the class feel uncomfortable. Whenever she says she will have something done, expect it later"

She is confrontational and you will be better off never to take her. Wright State performs a disservice to the students by keeping her teaching

She is very intense and intimidating, but the class was cake. It is hard to stay awake in the evening. She likes feed back and is willing to help: remind her for breaks."

She is confrontational and suspicious of everyone (including hospitals). Don\'t be late & you HAVE to go to lecture. I wouldn\'t want to be on her bad side. I guess some profs want you to know that they hold all the authority. Know your place, participate online, do the work."
