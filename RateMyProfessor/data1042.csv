When doing problems on the board he simply copies from his notes, often making mistakes. Concepts in the class aren\'t hard, it\'s just the algebra that gets you."

He makes notes before class on what he needs to go over and during every problem he stares at his own notes because he can\'t understand them because he doesn\'t understand the material. His class started with 160 students and now there\'s 30. Most of the students in his sections just go to different lectures.

The class is graded on journal presentations, write-ups, homework, and a final project -- no exams! He\'s a little unorganized at times and has bad handwriting, but other than that, he\'s a smart man that has a lot to teach"

I think he\'s used to grad students or something because he just cannot explain things to undergrads. Terrible teacher. Avoid at all costs!!
