John  Broberg,Wichita State University,Business department, Wichita, KS,7,2.9,N/A,3.5,,4,06/07/2016,ENTR310,2.0,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,No,B,,1,0,Nice guy however I felt like most of the work was busy work. There were too many ungraded activities while we did have allot of other graded more relevant work. He went off on a tangent too much about his opinions on specific topics rather than covering what\'s on the test. Doesn\'t online properly how to get an A. Nice but I\'d never recommend him.

I work full time and was still able to fit it in. Yes, it\'s a lot of work, but it\'s a great class. Dr. Broberg is kind, intelligent, well spoken and CLEAR. Hands down my favorite professor and class I\'ve taken at Wichita State. Open book tests! Project is tough but really fun, actually."

He assigns three HUGE projects. One of them is a group project, which is even worse since you HAVE to find an organization and volunteer for 100hrs outside of class. And to make it worse, you have to write a giant paper on each project. One is a 7 page paper. SINGLE SPACED."

Quiz over a chapter every tuesday and an in class assignment every thursday. CANNOT miss a class without losing points. Only one test (comprehensive final) but the quizzes are as hard as a test. must read book and know details to pass quizzes.
