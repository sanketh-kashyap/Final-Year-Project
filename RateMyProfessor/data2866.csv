Gives hw but doesnt check it and dont bother buying the textbook we never used it. just pay attention and ask questions.

TEST HEAVY  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"He was very funny and nice when he wanted to be. Although, despite his personality he was a very difficult teacher for a non-credit class. He always taught subjects in a very complex way when there were much easier ways of doing them. He was very slow with his lessons, not in a helpful way though. If you are absent a lot he WILL fail you."
