Stefan  Sereda,Wilfrid Laurier University-Waterloo,Film department, Waterloo, ON,3,3.5,N/A,2.0,,3,01/09/2013,FSFS,4.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I\'ve had him as both a TA and a prof and for the most part, he`s been really good. Though, at times, he does tend to blow off your opinions and is quick to tell you why you`re wrong. Overall, however, I like him a lot!"

The majority of his lectures involve asking student opinions or reading off of slides which we already had. I was letdown by my own expectations of a university level science fiction course and felt as if I had stumbled across a high school film club.

He\'s a brilliant guy and made his lectures rather entertaining. I went to every lecture only because I found his method of teaching so awesome. I definitely learned quite a bit in the class and I\'d highly recommend him to anyone in film. Plus he\'s definitely nice to look at! haha
