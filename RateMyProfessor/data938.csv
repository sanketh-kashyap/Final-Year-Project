I withdrew from the class because I did not want a grade from Darmanyan on my transcripts, whether that was an F or an A. My criticism is not of the demands he placed on students for the material (I have been a Dean\'s LIst Honor Roll student for my last 8 semesters)."

You need to study hard and be able to use basic knowledge to solve harder questions on the test. However, you\'ll learn a lot. Helpful to future study."
