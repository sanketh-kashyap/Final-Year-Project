The problem with Dr. Gray is that he gave up on teaching. His lectures are literally just him reading from a PowerPoint presentation where he has copy/pasted paragraphs/images from the book. Rarely, you can see a tiny teaching spark on topics related to his job.. but the learning atmosphere has long been dead."

His C++ class was very engaging, challenging, and rewarding. Seeing those words ""Hello World"" appear on the screen for the first time is an experience I\'ll never forget. Dr. Gray provides endless opportunities for you to improve your grades & really shows deep care for his students"

So instead he gave us a ""test guide"", it was all equations straight out of the text book which we were told not to use. He never assigned HW or gave example problems so it was impossible to study or prepare for the tests."

Everyone was forced to teach themselves and if you are brave enough to ask him a question be ready for an answer that he will try and embarrass you with in front of the class!"

I think Dr.G was a great teacher. He\'s kind of funny too. And who cares what he wears! Uno\'s engineering school obviously doesn\'t not require much in fashion. If I had to guess, these ratings are from students he didn\'t like."
