Avoid her at all cost. She makes my college life 10 times worse. Very condescending. Not willing to help. Wish the school fire her immediately.

One time I asked her a question in the office and after I finished talking, she said ""you tell me"" and started playing with her pens as if I weren\'t there. I wish the school could fire her seriously. Avoid her at all cost."

You get nothing out of her class unless you read the textbook and teach yourself. I agree with an earlier post that she is condescending, and it makes anyone who goes to her office hours very uncomfortable. In general she is very mean to the students. Avoid her AT ALL COST, no kidding."

When classmates had serious issues, she stopped allowing office appointments and stuck to her insufficient office hours, during which huge lines of panicked students choked the hallway to her office. She is condescending when help is needed (often)."
