Doesn\'t tell you what\'s on your tests or manage his time well- he missed 3 classes and made us make up all the work and take tests (the only grades in the class) when no one was sure what would be on them. Interesting topic, would take with someone else"

Only grades based on tests- experience papers from $10 mandatory concerts dont improve your grade. Class based on memorization-expect to memorize many names and songs that you will forget after. Makes a 100 level music appreciation class stressful and difficult-wouldnt take w him agai"

LOTS OF HOMEWORK  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,A LOT of classical and opera. must attend classical concerts and write reviews on them. tests are medium length but kind of hard. Wish i would have dropped the class. He said the textbook was mandatory but we haven\'t used it yet.

If you keep an open mind you will learn a lot about music and find some new favorite genres. The concert requirements are the only extra work really, and he\'ll direct you to the best shows in the city. Definitely knows his stuff."

He was one of my only professors to allow me to use my computer to take notes, he does talk fast. No extra hw, just go to a few concerts! Tests weren\'t that difficult if you study, multiple choice, short answer, and listening. I only studied one night in advance and made As/Bs!"

The class is way too much memorizing and not enough listening.

I love classical music, but have no training with musical instruments, and so thought I would be interested. I really tried to do well, and I didn\'t do badly, but the difficulty level was just ridiculous for Music Appreciation. He\'s a nice guy, but geez."
