But his online section this last semester has been terrible. New online section and very little attention paid to teaching, more on the grading. He isn\'t too tough of a grader if you really show you care, but its hard to do that online. I do not recommend if you care about a pretty GPA."

Classes were not mandatory. I had class Tues&Thurs and Thursdays were a lab for excel help. 3 Excel Homeworks to hand in at the end of the semester which were very easy as long as you have the required workbook & two open book exams. He made lectures fun & relatable. Overall an amazing guy & easy class.
