Tells you exactly what to expect on tests, which are open note/book/laptop, so no useless busy work like memorization or studying the wrong material. Be careful though, time limits can be tough and 90% of your grade is exams, which average around an 80%. Go to class and do the work and you\'ll be more than set."
