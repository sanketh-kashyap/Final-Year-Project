Everyone left that class sad, because it was so fantastic no one wanted it to end. All her directions were crystal clear, you could reach her very easily, her tests weren\'t tricky if you did the reading. She was a wonderful teacher, I would HIGHLY recommend this class or any other she teaches."

She would not do anything to help you get a decent grade. I got a B but by my own hard work not her help at all.
