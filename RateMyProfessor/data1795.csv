Often became argumentative with students when views over topics of race and class were discussed. My interests in the subject matter were deflated after taking this course. Would not recommend

I wasn\'t too sure of what to expect about Environmental Justice, but Weintraub really made it a great learning experience. Class grading is fair, with discussion and homework consisting bulk of grade, along with one paper and exam. If you have no idea what Env Justice is, this course is a must."
