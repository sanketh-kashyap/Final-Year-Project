AHS131 is a very hard class. she tries not to overwhelm you with too much info which is good. I had her for lecture, she gives a couple of extra credits that count towards the tests (Sometimes you have to ask for it). She follows the book. if you DONT GET BEHIND ON THE MATERIAL, STUDY UR CLASS NOTES & BOOK EVERYDAY you will do fine."
