Hanah  Allen,Adelphi University,Fine Arts department, Garden City, NY,3,3.8,N/A,3.8,,4,10/28/2012,ARH266,3.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Photo History with Hannah is a mixed bag. Yes, she teaches you a lot and you learn quite a bit. But the class is very methodical rather than historical, and if you are not an artist, especially a photographer, you could be quite confused if you take this class. Also, she is a very hard grader. That being said, she is willing to help students out."

She made me feel confident about the pictures i took. If i ever needed any help she would be more than happy to help me or any other student. Her dedication shows how great of a professor she is.

But considering it was a beginner class she went very quickly and expected us to feel confident with editing our pictures. However, if you had trouble she was willing to help. Tough grader."
