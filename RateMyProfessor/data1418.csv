BUT her class was incredibly confusing. She cancelled class all the time with little or no notice. She had many things due in her class but never fully explained things. She is nice but i do not recommend her! I learned NOTHING!"

With that said: She grades lesson plans hard and does not follow the rubric. Be very careful and ask lots of questions when she goes over the rubric. Write down what she wants and stick to what she says not the rubric. She takes off points for not using a paper clip. She does grade easy on all other assignments.

I didn\'t learn much from her class, and I wound up dropping the class because it was so difficult for me. Don\'t expect her to respond to e-mails quick either, or to be truly helpful."

The material that she goes over in class has nothing to do with the tests. Preparing for the tests are worse than gambling.. you never know what she is going to ask or where the information comes from. I honestly dont believe she even knows the material. Not to mention she is not a very friendly person..

I attended every class. Her assessments did not reflect the material she taught, which was minimal at best. I would say overall she is inept as a teacher and I feel completely unprepared for my reading methods course."

I heard she was a little scatter brained before taking her, but I would say that is putting it mildly. I would say over all ,she is inept as teacher."
