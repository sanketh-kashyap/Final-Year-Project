Actually just the worst professor.. Very hard to understand.. Seems like he\'s copying another professors syllabus and using the same unpublished textbook written by that professor. Seems like he relies heavily on Ritter\'s exact course schedule. Crappy labs that are the same exact format every single lab. Kind of pointless. Really wish I took this in the Fall as apposed to right now. The end result is that I feel like I\'m going to kill myself in this class.

But he is straight from France and has never taught an English class before and overall can\'t teach. Probably a great guy, but can\'t teach for crap. Worst class of the semester."
