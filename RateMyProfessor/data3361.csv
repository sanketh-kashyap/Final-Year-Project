David  Joyner,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department, Tacoma, WA,4,4.5,N/A,2.0,,3,11/11/2013,JAZZTHEORY,4.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Dr. Joyner is an amazing teacher. He is definitely my favorite professor at PLU. His mastery of jazz music is unmatched here, and his exuberant personality and ready smile makes learning from him genuine fun. His jokes never get old, and he keeps his lectures light. Just make sure to ask questions; he will leave you in the dust if you don\'t."

You can tell that he LOVES what he does and it impacts his teaching (which is good). I would recommend anyone to take his class (at least history of jazz). I am a jazz piano player so getting to hear a professional play every day in class was quite the treat! His tests are clear. Good class all around!

He loves what he does and despite being a chill jazz band director, he motivates everyone to play well. Not to mention, he gives some of the funniest quotes from any prof I\'ve ever had!"
