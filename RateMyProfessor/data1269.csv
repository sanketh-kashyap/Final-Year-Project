She is very passionate and has a lot to offer. She expects a lot out of you, but if you\'re dedicated and take acting seriously you will do just fine. Definitely recommend her and the class."

And these other rates are just whining. True she only cancel classes a few times but one she was pregnant and two, she is still and actress! Her class gets your mind and body in shape. Take her to have a better understanding of presence. And the ""3"" papers are super easy."

It\'s Week 9 and I still don\'t know what grade I will be getting. We never received grades for our monologue presentations at midterms.. We have final scene performances next week abut she canceled class so no one has any idea what we will be performing. We have 3 papers due the next week also....

She cancels class, but doesn\'t bother to notify the class. She scheduled an audition during class. After preparing for monologues, she told us the class was going on a field trip to her audition instead. I could have been devoting time to class assignments that actually mattered. Worst experience ever at DePaul."

Although she makes you do core workouts, she really wants your body and mind to be one. And to her everything is ""clear as mud"". I enjoyed taking her class, it helped improve my acting skills prior to the class."

Pretty intense with core workouts but got me in shape. I feel as if I could be an actor in a play after this course. Worth it, she knows what shes talking about."
