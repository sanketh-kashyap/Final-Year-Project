Pierre  Nguyen,Saddleback College,Biology department, Mission Viejo, CA,2,3.5,N/A,3.3,,12,07/20/2011,BIO20,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Had him just for my lab class,I adored him! He is great. His lectures for lab were always VERY clear. I was unsure about having two different bio teachers(one for lab and one for lecture) but this turned out to be no problem! He doesnt give away the answers ever, but makes it so YOU can answer the question by yourself."

Take notes on his lab lecture and review the chapters in the packet before tests and you\'ll do fine."

He tells you what you should take a look at for the tests. 4 Lab Practicals and One Final. You do have to study a lot though. Anyways, he\'s cool. Just try hard and you\'ll be fine."

He is always available to help as long as you ask. I\'m getting an A in the class. Just attend and take notes from his slides and you\'ll be good.

You have to pay attention because he calls on people randomly during his pre-lab lecture. And he takes points off your lab if your late...lame. But Ya he is really nice. Lab exams are kinda hard, but study and you will be fine!"

Four Hard exams, 6 pop quizzes, and one 4-5 page paper. Lab is mandatory, but it is usually fun and goes by fast. He will help you with lab questions if you ask, pretty easy going guy."

He does expect you to do your own work as in studying, which you have to do for any biology class. There is no homework except for a paper (dont worry its not that bad). If you ask for help he tries to hint at the anwser rather than just give it to you, so you understand it mor"

STUDY FOR THE TESTS! and you have to show up for lab, he takes roll. He doesn\'t care if you show up for lecture but it\'s in your best interest to do so because it helps to listen to his lecture rather then just copy notes."
