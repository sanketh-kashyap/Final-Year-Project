Rallin doesn\'t seem to care that we take this class to learn how to write papers for our other teachers. Instead, he wants us to be ""creative,"" but he doesn\'t tell us how, probably because he doesn\'t know. I really want to learn how to improve my writing, but instead the assignments were like what I did in high school"

He practices humanistic education in and outside of his class. He is very flexible and is able to accept different opinions and ideas from students. I learned a lot during workshop section where everyone gets to workshops their papers and have discussion after that.

He is all about pushing boundaries and alternative forms or critical analysis. If you are more logical in your prepossessing then this will be difficult for you. A typical, formally arranged research paper will not suffice. Do SOMETHING DIFFERENT."

I was embarrased about my writing before I took his class but after taking it,I was so motivated to write even for my other classes. The books he required for class were amazing. He has shown the power of a teacher,in many classes,in keeping a student motivated and helping them grow."
