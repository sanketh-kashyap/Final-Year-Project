The course was challenging but highly interesting. Going to class was never an issue because each one was different and compelling in it\'s own way. Not only was the material interesting but the guest speakers were AMAZING and really helped tie the history into relation to journalism all together.

She knows everything there is to know about journalism history. She\'s always well prepared, but relies heavily on powerpoints to teach. She\'s a tough grader. I would recommend taking her class. Attendance isn\'t mandatory, but she notices who is always in class. She\'s also very understanding."

(Sorry but real-life experience does not a good teacher make.)She\'s genius, great at pushing you to do good work and just a wonderful person. I\'ve never worked so hard and still liked someone as much as I do Sandy."
