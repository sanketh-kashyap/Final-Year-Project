(1),5,12/30/2015,ECON2301,5.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,INSPIRATIONAL  SKIP CLASS? YOU WON\'T PASS.  PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,I took Prof. Davia last Spring and before I finish my AA-FOS in Spring I had to leave him a review. I am shocked his reviews are so low. He is an amazing Prof. He lets the class decided if they would like to go honors or not individually. His lectures are great and the tests are open notes. He wants to see the class participate while learning.

(1),5,06/08/2011,ECON2301,4.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Mr. Davia is serious professor but very knowledgeable in economic. I took min term class and get B. Each student required to present 5 articles and 1 paper assingment to get 10% of total grade. The first test is hard in limited time (1 hour) with 31 multiple choices and a narative. Second and final test are easier and he give more time.

(1),5,07/29/2009,ECON2301,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,He makes his class seem so easy in the beginning. He says that his tests are not hard and that you can use all the written notes that you want. The midterm and the final are 45% of your final grade. BUT the notes do not help you at all! All of the questions are completely irrelevant to what is gone over in class. Plus he has this terrible accent.

He let you use your notes, but the test seems like they are in a foreign language. you have to write a 4 page term paper which is only worth 5% of your grade."

The first day of class he tells you,"" you can use any hand written notes you want for test"" which would be great if they applied. All his questions are situational, so as much as you study doesn\'t matter if you don\'t understand."
