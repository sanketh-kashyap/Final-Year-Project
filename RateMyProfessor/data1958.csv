He gave us a lot of opportunities to improve our grades. He understands if you have personal stuff and he cares that you are learning the material. I think I learned more how to be a student in his class than I have my other classes. He\'s also really funny and had us rollin all semester.

I study, study, study, but somehow he still finds the most random and obscure questions for the tests. Furthermore, many of the students that repeatedly don\'t study or do anything somehow have earned higher grades than me and other who HAVE studied their butts off!!"

He expects you to memorize the syllabus. His tests are really hard. I had him last semester for 1010 and he wasn\'t this hard. I don\'t know what happened but this semester he is really demanding and expects a lot.

Mr. Crowe is constantly on his game, gives good examples, and makes sure you get your every penny\'s worth of the textbook. I think he\'s sometimes too demanding and there\'s a lot of writing, but he\'s the greatest language teacher I\'ve had in four years. I\'ve never laughed as hard or learned as much."

Mr Crowe is super funny and super cool and really cares that people are learning. He totally calls you out and will get an attitude with you if you cop one with him. He\'s understanding and NOT UNREASONABLE! I learned more in this one class that I have in the past three semesters. LOT OF WRITING HERE THOUGH.

I think he might be gay, but I\'m not sure. It\'s so hard to tell these days. But he\'s really funny. And he gives you a lot of opportunities other teachers wouldn\'t. I know that if you make a C or lower and a test, he\'ll make you come to his office, but he\'s real understanding. I like him a lot."
