Emily  Hamblin,Brigham Young University-Idaho,Foreign Languages & Literature department, Rexburg, ID,0,4.7,N/A,3.0,,3,07/29/2009,SPAN0101,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Hermana Hamblin has the most useful syllabus on the planet. Every day you know what will be due, what you should have studied, and if you have a test. Her teaching is very clear and precise. She\'ll work to help the class understand grammar. You get daily points for attendance, so you won\'t fail if you miss ""over 3 days"" or anything like that."

She really cares about her students, and she always trying to come up with new ways to teach. She is an excellent teacher for those who are first learning how to speak Spanish. I highly recommend Hermana Hamblin!"

She is very dedicated to her students, and she expects them to be dedicated as well. It\'s mandatory to go to class, but it\'s not pointless. Some classes you have to go, but it\'s completely pointless and you hate it. I highly recommend her."
