If you want to pass, you will have to put a good amount of effort into understanding the material in and outside of class. His classes (in my experience) are all lecture, but they are by no means boring--they are fast paced and full of information, pray attention. I would highly recommend him."

He will get you to learn a large amount of material in a short amount of time (provided you follow the syllabus and pay attention). However, his personality is inconsistent outside of the classroom.

He has spent years not only in the jazz field but also in the musicology field. You have no choice but to take his class as a music major. Trust me, it is necessary. It is like boot camp. Some people do not make it through the class, but it is also the music department\'s way of sifting through the people who do not deserve degrees."
