Wants students to learn the material and does what is needed to make that happen. Easy IF you work with her. If you show you aren\'t interested she will make things difficult (as it should be). I am very glad I had her as a Prof. (not relevant, but she is VERY easy on the eyes!!!)"

She makes every effort to explain the material, backtracking to prior chapters if we seemed lost. The workload was surprisingly light -- a take home test and two class exams -- and she allowed us to redo one of the exams. Take her class if you want a professor that cares."
