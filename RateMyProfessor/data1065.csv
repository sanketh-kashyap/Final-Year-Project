HE WAS AMAZING! Listen everybody. His lectures are all online (meaning attending class not needed). He gave extra credit on every quiz(the quizes were vocab words 5 Q\'s). His tests were super easy(matching, mulitple choice) one test we got was 75% matching. Super nice guy. Reading notes = A"

He posts his power points online which was helpful. His test and quizzes come from those. one thing i really hated was that i asked him for extra credit and he would not give any out.
