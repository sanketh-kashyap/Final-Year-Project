He used to suggest better ideas to help me improve my projects. Very nice man who is laid back and relaxed. He doesn\'t stress you. I enjoyed his class very much!!!!!! I kinda slacked a little bit on my first projects but he still gave me a good grade cause his cool!!

The advises he gives for constructing your project are criticized by other professors. He always seems to be nervous and unprepared to explain a project.
