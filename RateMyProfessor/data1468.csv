All you do is read a chapter, memorize definitions, take a quiz right after, take an 3-4-chapter exam on those definitions and forget all you read once you are out of class. On top of this he is a boring lecturer."

The dept head has mandated a curriculum for all professors to follow; online quizes 2x a week, 1 test every 3 weeks. either read the textbook or find the questions online. he doesn\'t care if you pay attention but he takes attendance so show up and seem awake.

I\'d have liked to see the same for the papers. I didn\'t understand how the papers were graded. Some of the materials used was dated. Favors participation but doesn\'t encourage it by making dismissive and curt remarks. It was a challenging class. More like a debate class. I wouldn\'t have retaken it.
