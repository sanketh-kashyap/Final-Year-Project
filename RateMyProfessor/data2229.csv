He grades hard, but the amount you learn is worth it. You will get several E\'s. I fondly recall my first \'E\' and the angry suburban mom email I sent him about it, but YOU\'LL BE FINE. A year after his class, I still hang with Tom to gossip and get advice."

Looking back, I would take every class with him. Yes, the class was difficult as 201 is your sort-of intro to reporting, but I learned so much with him as my teacher. He\'s hilarious and is great at keeping the teachings relevant and meaningful."

The information from the lectures and newspapers is all he quizzes on. I\'ve been told he\'s one of the easier teachers, but he\'s a tough grader to me. He does want you to succeed, but he doesn\'t make it clear how to succeed. He is very unpredictable. Uses cryptic wording in quizzes. His teaching style is a little too informal."
