He does expect you to put in work but he\'s down to earth and caring in many aspects. My issue in the class was the course material but I believe that was from faults in earlier sections from previous semesters. (This is Music Theory 3 out of 4 total sections).

Class is never dull. He\'ll go way out of his way to help you succeed in both class and life. He\'s probably the most intelligent and caring professor at NKU. You learn a lot. I recommend him. Don\'t know what I\'d do without him!"

But it feels like we actually ""learn"" at the end of class (the last 10 minutes or so) feeling a bit rushed. Homework can be a bit overwhelming at times too, considering the pre-req classes leading up to this have about half the amount of work. Sometimes a bit too critical with students/views too."

More than willing to help you and if he can\'t fit you into his incredibly busy schedule he will advise someone for you to go to. The only thing is that he won\'t be as helpful if you don\'t attend his class but I agree with him cause he\'ll do his job if you do yours, which is to go to class"

Sometimes hard to follow if you haven\'t been in class for awhile cause he goes off on tangents sometimes. But he explains the material well and is a really good teacher. Will give you help outside of class and will explain what himself if you misunderstand something.
