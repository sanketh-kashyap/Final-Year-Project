She is a hard grader on the speeches and classwork..seems a little unfair at times. However, I\'d reccommend the class."

She will get your work back to u n a timely fashion. She is a hard grader on journals, but she is overall ok on the grading. U will have open notes quizzes (thats a plus, three exams, individual career packet (10-15pg), and group assignment. Hectic at the end of the semester. Overall a wonderful class!"

Tests are very easy and she gives a great review before them which is helpful. Do not text in her class, you will be counted as absesnt even if u answered every question that day. Go to class for small classworks not taking is not necessary all the notes are in the book. buy the book it helps!"

Her class is conducted in a professional manner and she is very thorough and exact in her teaching, grading and explanations. It can become a bit tedious at times, but not too bad. The class is relatively easy, it is a 100 level class after all, but not that boring. Strongly recommend Golstein."

I\'m not a mass comm major and I got a B. It was a little more than and basic 100 level class. The end of the semester there was an individual project which came out to about 10 page paper and along with it there was a group project. 3 exams 5 journal entries and about 9 quizzes and lowest grade gets dropped. Definitely take her.
