If you opppose his beliefs, your papers will not result in good grades leaving you with a poor grade in the class. Do not take him."

His course content did not meet his own expectations. Cool, funny guy but not a good professor."

Rarely gives out homework and the midterm and final are take home essays. Very boring class but he means well. Do not take at 8 am.

Hes almost too smart for his own good. He goes off on tangents because his mind is just all over the place and therefor, so is the class. He is also a really harsh grader."

He enjoys the sound of his own voice, talking about his own research and more boring topics like women in the 1800?s, bad novels, whaling?Yuck! Yet he?s nice, sometimes funny, a little cute, helpful outside of class, and kind of an easy grader. Also, attendance is not mandatory :)"

MUST PARTICIPATE to get decent grade!"
