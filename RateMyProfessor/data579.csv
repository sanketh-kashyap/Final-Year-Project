Her knowledge on Native American literature is impressive and her passion shines through in her work. Do your reading and be prepared to discuss the material. She is very open to interpretation. I loved this course and would most definitely take one of her courses again.

She is a very strict, but reasonable grader. Don\'t try to BS your way through an essay or exam because she\'ll spot it a mile away. Awesome professor -- much learned -- I feel very disciplined and stronger."

The poetry books were so dry I could not take it. Every day class was like like going to a book club. I would recommend her to anyone!"

The entire class was structured around issues in higher education and that was extremely boring as all papers had something to do with that subject. BORING!"
