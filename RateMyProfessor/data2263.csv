He has some misogynistic tendencies, and honestly he didnt teach anything. If you want to learn, take Schumann\'s class. If you just want to get by then yeah, take this class, but honestly, if you are paying over 1k for it, why would you want a crappy professor?"

For following reasons His teaching style is continuous bombardment of theories with no deep dive of the applications For a buss comm class he is a tough grader. Even with full participation he does not give full grades. Donald Schumann\'s class is better to take for Bus9553

This was a Continuing Education course, so the setup was different. However, if I have to take a business course at Baruch or NYU, I would choose him."

Very helpful in helping students improve their oral and written communication skills. His comments on presentations/written assignments have been invaluable in helping me, as well as my fellow classmates, improve. Also, you can resubmit assignments if you aren\'t happy with your grade. One of my favorite professors."

Grading was easy for the written parts (you can resubmit). He\'s a little picky about presenting styles, but feedback was helpful. Class is basically a repeat of BusComm 1, so don\'t expect too much. Recommend, esp. in the summer."

He is engaging and will keep you from falling asleep during a 0 credit class. Each assignment will be graded and you\'re given the chance to redo/resubmit with his suggested edits for a higher grade.

Easygoing, pleasant, flexible, constructive. Tries his hardest to make the class relevant to you getting hired (something the curriculum doesn\'t focus on).
