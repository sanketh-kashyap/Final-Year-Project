I read these comments and at the first lecture, I was hesitant. But seriously, he is not that bad. The material is challenging but its college, every class should challenge students a little bit. He explained the material very well with examples and illustrations. He has a lot of passion for cognitive neuroscience."

Then again, maybe that is my bias because he is adorable. The whole of my impression comes from his lectures in which he seems interested in studying and teaching and portrays a good sense of humor and eagerness to help. This is a challenging class."

Motivates students to try their best to achieve an A. There are quizzes/attendence clickers in lectures. Very nice guy. Talked to him during office hour and was very helpful! I strongly recommend you taking him. Class is very entertaining and he uses videos to demonstrate what he\'s teaching.

He was very arrogant and told the class that he was used to teaching students that went on to get their PHD\'s, what a jerk! Boring Class!

He did not treat us at our level, but rather as if we were the vast majority of the students from HIS school that went on to get their Ph.D.\'s. Tests were very hard and book was not too helpful."

He spoke to the class as if it was a graduate level class and the exams were difficult. Interesting demos but otherwise lecture was not so interesting. Please take Andersen for this class since he is the one that regularly teaches this class.
