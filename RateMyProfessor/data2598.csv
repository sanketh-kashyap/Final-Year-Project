I had to memorize everything in the book, but I was able to get an A. You have to put a lot of energy and time in the class. I am aware this is college, but the work can be a bit unexpectedly rigorous for the subject. His grading system is fair though. He does not respond to emails unless you have a huge emergency. So, go to office hours"

At least not with Cohen. He is very monotone, it\'s all slideshows and videos easy to get lost or confused it doesn\'t make much sense and he won\'t explain it.

I got an A. Those that complain are the type that barely show up, leave early, don\'t do HW, and don\'t study. Then they wonder why they don\'t pass. They come here and blame the teacher for THEIR failure. Not a bad class at all, don\'t listen to these people."

I constantly left class because of his narrow-minded opinions he kept preaching. I was so confused about what the class was even teaching, but I got an A."

He\'s so jolly, funny and extremely helpful. His quizes and tests are not too hard as long as you do the homework and study a bit. His class is very interesting, and informative. Prior to Mr. Cohen\'s class, I was not interested in Anthropology, let alone Linguistic Anthro, but after his class I now absolutely love it. A+ Teacher."

He is so boring! and he laughs at his lame jokes, its pathetic. Mandatory textbooks, attending class, no one looked forward to this class. Take anyone but Cohen, if you can, trust me."
