You wont have much work, but you will need to go to class for the notes. He is a really nice guy and very understanding. Willing to explain anything you need until you get it. Awesome professor."

I got a C but I honestly didn\'t put much effort in his class. He\'s kind of on the older side. Don\'t be so hard on him. Just know that as long as you are really putting in a REAL effort in his class you\'ll learn & come out on top.

I really like the fact that he was willing to help me out after class so this to me was a major plus. I recommend him because he really cares about your level of understanding in the class.

If I had to take another lower level biology class I would take his class not because he is so easy but he clarifies what he is teaching instead of quoting a textbook."

He was real easy to lie to about unexcused absences. You dont have to come to class everyday but you notes will be missed. You will learn a lot about his family cause he talk about them during every class...GOOD LUCK
