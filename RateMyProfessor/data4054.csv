Lectures are interesting and he is very adaptable to your specific class in terms of where they stand and the vibes the class gives out. He is a tough essay grader and not much is graded so you have to do well on what is handed in.

Excellent at creating discussions and filling ""voids"" if students don\'t have a response. Very helpful at helping students develop writing skills via comments on papers and short ""paragraphs"" at the end of papers"

He pushes students to think critically and his skill at discussing themes which are often taboo is impeccable. If you do the reading, participate, and really follow up on his advice with your papers (and meet with him), you will do fine."

Class is pretty boring, but there\'s not much work and if you ask for help then he will give it to you. There\'s a group presentation, midterm/final, and a few papers. Just do the work/readings and you\'ll be fine."

I took his Roots of Literature course and was extremely impressed. He is extremely passionate and spends a lot of time trying to put an interesting spin on the classics. Attendance and participation is mandatory, which seems to bother some people. Great professor if you\'re willing to put in the work!"

He does put you on the spot because he expects you to be keeping up with the readings. The readings were really interesting and he is a fair grader.
