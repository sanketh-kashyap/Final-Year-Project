Do the assignments and show up to class without an attitude problem and you\'ll be fine. He can get a little annoying sometimes just because people tend to take advantedge of his good nature and walk all over him until he snaps and gets upset. Really nice guy though.

Don\'t screw it up...you\'ll miss out on a lot of learning from an extremely knowledgeable and passionate professor (for both Theory I and II)."

So few assignments that if you mess up on one it will terribly hurt your grade. We did 2 homeworks, 2 tests, and the final. If youre a music person and know the material already it is terribly boring. He put people on the spot a lot so you have to know whats going on. Attendance is required, ugh."
