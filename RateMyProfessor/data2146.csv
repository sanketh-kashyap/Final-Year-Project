He was not afraid of teaching students how to meditate. I highly recommend his Zen Buddhism class. It was very nice to learn Buddhism from a real practitioner.

Last semester, he had a panel come in, along with several guest speakers. He gave us a variety of views and opinions. His readings were also very interesting. And, he would admit when he did not know a lot about something -- more helpful than pretending. I am glad to have him at Hampshire"

He is really into conversation based classes and interactive learning. he might even take the class on an interesting field trip or bring in a speaker that relates to the reading. In addition, You might get some mediation or chanting experience. =)"

I believe that ""studying Buddhism through material objects"" is one of the best ways to learn about Buddhism. Ryan was easily approachable, and passionate about the course. We were given a good grasp of topics through reading and discussion, but also through direct experience (e.g. chanting) where appropriate."

I also felt as if his class was being taught in a very kindergarden-like style, not appealing as a college student. He also really likes youtube videos and using the internet as a way to connect the class."
