Quizzes/ reports not dropped in CHEM 102 tho. She wants u to come to lab on time and make sure u read the lab before coming or u will be lost more often. It\'s also good to do the lab report right after the lab or u will find yourself struggling the night before the next lab, not to mention pre- proceedure+ quiz"

She grades pretty seriously. She requires you write page long pre-labs before the lab, and if you forget it, she kicks you out. Her lab reports are anywhere between 3-6 pages (most of it is calculations though) and its worth 10-20 points If you do take her, dont do the pre-lab questions. Not on any quiz/exams"
