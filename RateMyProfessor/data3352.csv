YOU WON\'T PASS.  HILARIOUS,0,0,"I adore Eddie. He\'s a great teacher, very helpful. I don\'t know why anyone is saying that he\'s full of himself. He\'s very sweet and he is confident, not an egomaniac."

So a little harsh on Eddie Tapia from the coments below me. I feel like eddie teaches in a way that keeps you interested by referring his stories and films he shows to his lectures. I feel like the lab assignments really help us write creatively I just wish the word count was higher or had no limit.

Spent 2 hours talking about himself...he is cocky and i have learned nothing from him.

Talks about his wife more than she would like for to him to mention probably. Never on time. Break time is for him. Never available during class to ask questions. Tells stories a lot that do not seem true. Has no business teaching.
