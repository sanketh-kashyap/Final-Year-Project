Extra credit opportunities through quizzes & experimetrix."

Fair on tests, gives extra points. Definitely one of the classes I looked forward to most this quarter. Basically tells you all you need to go so just attend lecture."

He tells you which pages you need to read in the book as well. If you read those pages and go to lectures I am sure you will get a good grade. He\'s awkward at times but he is a nice guy and means well. :)

Even though I\'m not a PSYC major, his class was pretty easy! Just go to all his lectures, he makes them so entertaining you don\'t fall asleep or anything. He\'s a really nice guy and his TAs are super nice too! Tests are heavily lectured-based. I\'d take him again!!"

He explains the material very well and makes note-taking very easy (powerpoint). His tests are not that hard, but some questions might be tricky, but he offers bonus points. This class is interesting, but there is a lot of things you need to memorize."

Anything in the textbook that is not discussed in lecture will not be tested, which reduces LOTS of studying time. On the 1st midterm, about 40-ish% of the class this quarter got A\'s and B\'s and the avg was 77%. The multiple choice can be tricky, so make sure you really understand the concepts."

Very fun and personable. However, psych the 120 and 121 class is hard. I\'m talking about a quiz every other week about 60 questions long at the average that you half to memorize. However, he allows a retake every friday. I\'d rather have a great teacher and a hard class, then vice versa. I\'d say take him."

Very entertaining professor, used South Park\'s characters as examples in class. Most of the material comes from notes, but in my case, reading the book helped. The exams are tricky, so don\'t wait until the last minute to study. Terms can get confusing after a while, but hey, it\'s behavioral psych."
