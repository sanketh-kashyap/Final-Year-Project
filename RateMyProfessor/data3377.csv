Gordon  Smith,Colorado State University,Chemical Engineering department, Fort Collins, CO,0,3.0,N/A,2.0,,1,04/14/2009,CBE101,3.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Really bad professor. He basically just came to class and read you equations he had previously printed out for the class..like we can\'t read them ourselves. I can\'t honestly say I did not learn a single thing in that class except for what a rotameter is.
