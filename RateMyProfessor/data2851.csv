Morris  Garfinkel,Wayne County Community College - Western,Humanities department, Belleville, MI,5,4.8,N/A,1.5,,6,11/25/2014,SPEECH101,4.5,3.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Theres a reason why out of 30 people in the class, we were left with 8 regulars at the end. He has those who he prefers(these are the only people who he can name) which isnt helpful if he needs to tell you how you improved in your speech, since he cant remember your speeches. Also talks way too much about the same things."

He makes it easy to talk infront of other people, even though I didnt have a problem with public speaking before. He does go off about random things sometimes. We had about 8 speeches planned, but only did like 4 because he talks so much during class. Either way, the class wasnt bad at all."
