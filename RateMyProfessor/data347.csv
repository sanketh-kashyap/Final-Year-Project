I would totally have him again as one if I could! He is there for the students in all that he can be. He is very funny and makes jokes, but while still taking his job seriously.

He is awesome! He\'s officially my favorite Lab Instructor. He\'s really helpful when he can be and he is willing to walk you through the lab and all the calculations. He\'s really good at Kermit the Frog impersonations. Do take him! He\'s well worth it! Not too hard on the eyes either. :)

He\'s helpful leading up to qual analysis. after that he won\'t help you. he\'s not supposed to but i think he takes it a bit too far. he\'s very funny and cool to be around. One major negative is his being overly picky on quiz answers. nothing is good enough so i just stopped trying. great guy though.

Chem lab instructors dont really teach much about the subject. He is there for you in his office hours if you need him but lab is mainly just for seeing what we are talking about in lecture. Anyways im taking him next year because hes cool!

He does not seem to be excited about class which does not help the student\'s attitudes about chem lab.
