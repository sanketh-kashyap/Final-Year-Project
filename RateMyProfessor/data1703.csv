But have to admit he\'s boring. If U can\'t pull any chem out of your memory from high school, then he\'s not clear at all although he\'s very helpful and nice. Don\'t buy book for his class, u\'ll never use it, ppt printing is just enough."

Chemistry is no easy subject, but he explains everything thouroughly. Sometimes he can get confusing but if you ask questions he clarifies stuff. As long as you are there to complete labs and study for quizzes and exams no one should fail. Even if Jason doesnt clarify enough for someone there are tutors on campus."

Doesn\'t explain things! He expects us to know how to work the problem with out even explaining to us why a problem is set up the way it is, what buttons to use on the scientific calculator, and how we got some answers. It is close to impossible to get an A in any of his tests because they are just plain hard. Don\'t recommend him!"

I only wished I had looked him up before I registered for this class. It was the most boring class I have ever had and he doesnt explain ANYTHING. He grades really hard and expects you to just know everything. My book taught me everything.
