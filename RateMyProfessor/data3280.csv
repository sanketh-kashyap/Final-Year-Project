Was always willing to explain again and stay after with students. Let the class out early on most days. Brags too much about her french class.

If she was teaching another level, I would take her as well. She is very nice, very understanding and a great person. She makes things easy to understand and if you dont she does more than enough to help out her students. It\'s not just memorizing, we also speak the language in class which I love. MUST TAKE!"
