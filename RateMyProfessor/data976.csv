Lacy  Meeks,Skagit Valley College - (ALL),English department, Mount Vernon, WA,7,3.1,N/A,2.7,Tough Grader (2)  Participation matters (2)  Hilarious (1)  Caring (1),11,01/29/2016,ENG101,1.5,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,B,TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"Ms. Meeks gave hardly any feedback! And when she did, it was weeks after the next paper was due. For example: by the time we turned in essay number 4, she was just grading essay number 2 resulting in you having NO idea what to do better on due to having no idea what you had done wrong. Would never take her class again."

She was relate-able and wanted to make sure everyone understood. She is a nice person, but does have her mind set on which professors she does not like and will tell you. She was a pretty good teacher and I would take her again if I could. Satisfied."

She didn\'t grade anything until week 7 and gave poor feedback. Lacy is a tough grader, and I mean tough. I\'ve had really hard English professors, but have always gotten A\'s. This class I\'m not so sure. If you can avoid to take it with Meeks, then do."

Good course content, but she\'s a hard grader for writing assignments. The biggest problem was that she didn\'t grade any of the writing assignments until the quarter was over, which make up most of the grade."

I appreciated her organization. Assignment due dates were predictable and the material was well organized so you wouldn\'t miss assignments. Writing my first paper over 8 pages, it was hard, but that was also because I picked a boring subject (my bad). If you are self motivated, I\'d recommend her. Use the tutor center for extra credit."

Constantly got off topic during discussions. Constantly made excuses when she didn\'t get things graded in time. Not very organized. I felt as though she was controlling and cynical.

We didn\'t write any essays until the last month of the class, which made it difficult to improve our abilities to write essays due to the lack of feedback on our prior work. This wouldn\'t be such a problem if the essays weren\'t worth so many points."
