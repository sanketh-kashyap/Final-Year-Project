This course was simply O.K. The material was somewhat interesting and the work was easy. I ended the semester with a 96, which is a 4.0 . I thought the teacher came off a little snobby when you tried to contact her about a problem but other than that, the course was good. Take if you want an easy A."

It is very defined on what you have to do. When it comes to actually solving problems that is a completely different story. When conflict arises and you attempt to involve her nothing gets solved. The ppl who did nothing still get credit and she just basically tells you all to be ""nice"". Pray you get a good group."

Quizzes are fairly easy-always 1 trick question(go with gut). Loved the no time limit on quizzes or tests! All papers are group projects-blah! But made 100\'s on them! She\'s clear on assignments (emails info & planned slllabus)&always responds. Not hard to get an A if you make the effort.

I was nervous about taking this class in the summertime since it\'s a half term class so it\'s only a few weeks long. She definitely eliminated a lot of stuff for the summer so that you\'re not drowning in homework. A couple of discussions and quizzes a week, a test, a group project, and a final. Very easy online summer class!"

I have taken about 15 online classes; this is by far the most confusing I have ever taken. The discussions are easy. The group project and other assign. probably would be easy if she taught us how to do them!! She hardly responds, and when she does they are USELESS responses. Who knows what grade I will get?"
