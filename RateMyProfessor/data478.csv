It was on an interesting subject and sometimes I felt like I learned a lot. However, I really did not like the tests he gave us. There were multiple subjects we spent entire class periods on that never came up on test but then there would be multiple questions on tangent related topics that we barley talked about."

I recommend his Sustainability class. His test questions are easy to understand and he doesn\'t try to trick you. We did two presentations and some reading. His lectures are interesting and he has a lot of energy. He tried to make the class enjoyable for students.

Tierney pushes you to think critically about current issues, the class is difficult, but completely worth it as you actually learn"

His enthusiasm rubs off on the class and makes it more exciting. It\'s a hard class because there aren\'t very many points possible so it\'s necessary to do pretty well on everything to do well in his class. His tests come straight from his lectures so take good notes.

Also very egocentric. He lectures like he\'s speaking to kindergartners. Lectures are also politically driven. Class is less about geography than it is him spewing his personal agenda.

However, i was a little disappointed this quarter because he stopped teaching halfway through and now we have an incredibly boring lady who just drones on for two hours. but that\'s why the invented laptops."

If you\'re interested in current events, you\'ll enjoy this class. Also, we took a couple field trips during class that were very thought-provoking. This was a great foundations class since Sean encouraged discussion and put less emphasis on busy work."

He was very engaging, very interesting, and really made you think. Not the type of class you can just coast through, but if you show up every day and take notes you should be good to go."
