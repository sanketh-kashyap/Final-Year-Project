Her tests are hard but everything on it is from the lecture slides. Just study your notes and lecture slides hard and you will do well.

Her exams were extremely difficult and she doesn\'t like to be involved much in clinical and lecture besides minimum. She prefers students in her clinical group. You\'re on your own and you will have to study very hard to adjust to the first semester.

She covers materials clearly in class and tests primarily from lecture! Listen to her lectures, record them, and listen to them again! Test questions come off the ppt slides, covered in lecture - you need to put your time in but you can do very well in Marty\'s class!!"

Some test questions not covered in class so it\'s hard to study for tests. Overall supportive and wants you to succeed."
