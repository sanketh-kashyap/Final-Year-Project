Javier  Chavira,Governors State University,Art department, University Park, IL,7,3.3,N/A,2.0,,4,09/30/2016,ART2200,1.0,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,No,N/A,,0,0,"Javier doesn\'t take his students into consideration, he was my advisor and never informed me how much his class as well as the other art classes would cost me out of pocket. His only advice to me was drop his class when I presented him with my concerns. He\'s very bland when it comes to his responses to his students."

No idea what he was looking for on paper or essays. Very boring, read from notes during lectures, monotone. Might be great painting instructor but not good with art history."

He is considered a mentor to me because about students moving forward. He has a very remarkable background in the art program. He is well liked by his students because his students enjoy his class and listening to him. I can honestly say that he wants his students to be successful.
