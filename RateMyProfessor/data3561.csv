Always willing to help out no matter what and goes above and beyond what is expected from a professor. Challenging class but if you put in effort and time you will definitely be able to do well!

He is very clear and easy with grading, you just need to listen to his presentations. He really hates when students walk in more that 2 minutes late, if it is a normal thing. He doesn\'t really have a sense of humor, but he is nice and will help if you ask."

Classroom lecture was pointless since all you needed to do was look at previous papers written by students to get an idea on how to write the paper. Does give 20 extra points at the end of the semester for perfect attendance however he adds 20 points to points available so the 20 points become moot

He really helped you understand the material and told you exactly what he wanted in your papers. As long as you try on your papers, do the journal entries (super easy points), and participate in class...You will have no problems! Attendance is mandatory, you can only miss like 3 or 4 days. But he make is fun to come to class."

Gives about a month for each essay, which are all 3-4 pages in length. Gives PP lectures during which he tells you exactly how he wants you to write the essay. If you pay attention, there is no way you can\'t get an A. Awesome teacher, very nice, very cool. Extra credit if you miss only 0-3 days."

I really like that we can sent him the essays and not have to print them out. He give powerpoints for each essay, also give us mini writing excercises that are not hard.

He lets you pick essay topics sometimes. Very clear on what he wants from his students. Before essays we have powerpoints on examples. Pretty easy grader. Come to class it\'ll help you.

He is so laid back and chill, but when it comes to work, he means buisness. He is so helpful with the essays and what he expects from you.

You do your work, he won\'t give your low grade. The whole class is for the final research paper, due at the end of the semester. He breaks the research paper into pieces so you can work on it piece by piece. And the final exam is just a paragraph analyzing one article for a bit."

Mr. O is so easy going. I couldn\'t make it the day our first paper was due because I had stomach flu and he was so understanding. He also let me make up a project after I got a concussion.

Breaks things down and explains what you need to learn and isn?t that picky, and very organized. Gives good writing assignments, and makes them broad so you can have fun with it.
