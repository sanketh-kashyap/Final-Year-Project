BUT, he is a great guy in person. I believe that if he was in a smaller class he\'ll teach 10X better. The Content of the course is interesting. I like the class cause it was easy going =P no stress."

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU DON\'T HAVE TO. There is nothing engaging about it. It\'s not that the subject matter isn\'t interesting, cause it is - Chan just manages to make everything excruciatingly boring."
