She gives you extra credit for everything. Just attend class to watch the movies, she gives you all the answers to the tests, no reading required. Easiest A ever. Also, she uses ""aesthetic"" in EVERY sentence."

If you attend class then you\'re fine, you don\'t even have to do the reading. She\'s very interesting and understanding. No textbook required, only a reader(I didn\'t even buy it and I got an A). To the person above: There is no right answer to dance! Duh! Her exams are straight-forward and easy."
