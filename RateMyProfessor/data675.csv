Dr. Mick makes EVERYONE comfortable and is so encouraging especially to those who have more difficulty doing so. He\'s a forgotten hippie from the day and a bit scattered, but that makes him more endearing. I loved taking this class from him!"

His class was fun and as long as you come to class and do the speeches to the outline he gives then you should have no problem getting an A. He\'s so nice and helpful and wants everyone to succeed. You would have to be a huge slacker not to do well in his class.

He\'s also a reverend but he\'s probably the happiest guy you\'ll ever meet. His classes are fun and engaging, and he really has a way of drawing the class together while at the same time teaching the material. A+"
