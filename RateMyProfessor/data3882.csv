You will learn so much about science and about how teach and engage your students when it comes to science. Her class is so fun and you get to do great labs everyday. She is a bit tough when it comes to grading but if you follow the rubric then you can make an A no problem. She is always willing to help! Take her!!!

I thought I was going to dread this class because I am not good at science. However, I now would like to be a science teacher because of this professor! She\'s very insightful, has many good stories, is flexible, and cares for her students. Tough grader, but a great professor."

The labs are fun and interesting. there\'s a lot of them, but the lectures are long and boring. Participation matters and you must follow the rubrics very closely. Doesn\'t accept late work and you have to do a journal everyday so make sure you keep up with that because she will take off points. I liked her mostly."

This never happened. Always left at the time class ended. Teacher reads off powerpointsboring lectures. Activities are fun. Participation grade matters. Hard grader. Doesn\'t help you to raise your grade in the end. Everything matters in this class.

I went into this class having always avoided Science like the plague. After taking her class, I am now wanting to teach Science. Her class did not feel like class at all. It is full of fun labs. You learn without even realizing that you are learning. Follow the rubrics very closely, and you will do fine. I LOVED THIS CLASS! TAKE HER! :)"

FOLLOW THE RUBRIC for any assignment you turn it - there is nothing without a rubric!! Your DAP\'s will probably need to be at least 6 or 7 pages long, longer if you want full credit. NOTE: grading is weighted, you can still make an A even with half-credit on some assignments."
