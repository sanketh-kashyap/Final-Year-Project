Lectures are a test of patience and endurance. He prohibits use of course assigned text as a source for information. I simply don\'t know why he is still teaching. The worst experience at CTU yet.

The course was difficult, but having an instructor who can not be understood verbally or intellectually and who when asked about it, just blamed it on the audio system, and referred to other reading material is next to nothing. If I had to take another course from this prof - I\'d quit!"
