LECTURE HEAVY  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,He is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He doesn\'t help when you ask questions he just repeats the same thing instead of trying to help you understand. NO homework grade is COMPLETELY exams and the exams are HARD. Never thought I would want homework. I would not recommend taking his class.

Those lectures are not online, either. You are given 3 exams, and an optional final. The optional final WILL replace your lowest of the 3 exams, whether higher or lower than the lowest exam."
