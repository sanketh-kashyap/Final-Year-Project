Youre expected to read a chapter, go to class and just know how to do problems without any type of example or explanation. Recitation is to review but when asked about how its done, you get incomplete answers and its how its is in the book. If can avoid, but live in tutoring."

She work so hard. If she is not in lab, she is in math & science center. Without her literally no one can pass this course. She will answer any of your question. Just ask her. I know lot students failed but you must know studying chemistry is combination of lecture, tutoring, and self-study. Dont miss any of these"

However, be warned, she gives A LOT of work to prepare you for exams. She\'s overall nice, but somewhat inconsiderate in the workload that she gives. If you do take her, don\'t be intimidated by her pushy personality."

Funny and approachable but will come down hard on you for making stupid mistakes e.g. not following safety procedures. Always willing to help go over questions if you don\'t understand but be warned she doesn\'t allow repeats or make ups. I recommend her for lab
