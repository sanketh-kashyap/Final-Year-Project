Be ready to study your butt off. She will say the test would be basic stuff, DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THAT, she will make you sweat."

She sets clear and concise goals, and she is super professional. Just do the homework, study it, and tests are not hard. Her comments are very helpful too; she knows the material very well. The hardest thing about tests, for me, was time. It really killed me on the final. Make sure you know the subject and perform quickly."

Homework policy goes as follows: get 50% or more on all of your assignments or she\'ll drop you down a letter grade. STAY UP-TO-DATE ON ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. The homework assignments will take hours, don\'t procrasturbate. Tests are rough, study hard. BELIEVE"

She\'s very professional in setting clear academic goals and expectations for her students. She also takes the time in labs to sit with any student who needs help or a deeper explanation of the material. She seems personally interested in helping her students succeed -Awesome!

Also, read the chapters. This will help you immensely. Her tests were fair, her homework was doable (just don\'t let it go), and the class builds so if you are getting behind, redouble your efforts. Also, her accent isn\'t bad at all."
