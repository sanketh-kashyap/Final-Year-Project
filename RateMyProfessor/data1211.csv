The book is called ""The Science of Psychology"" but most of the time on this class is spent on introspective discussion. Writing assignments are disturbingly personal. (Ever hear of HIPAA?) Psychological issues and family problems are personal and no professor should force you to disclose them in order to get an A. Avoid!"

She is very helpful. I highly recommend her. You must study for this class in order to get a ""A"". If you get a bad grade, you didn\'t study."
