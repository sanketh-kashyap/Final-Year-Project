He is pretty good about giving assignments that you can complete if you paid attention in class and completed the homework. He has industry experience and is American, so no accent problems."

He takes great interest in his students and is always helpful. CIS 4120 is a class for people who don\'t really want to take programming classes which is a plus. I HIGHLY recommend taking this professor for any class!!!
