LOTS OF HOMEWORK,0,0,Manny really cares about his students and makes sure that they get what he is explaining. He knows that we are not all chemists so he tries to use every day examples so that you can relate them to chemistry. His exams are difficult so you really have to study and there is also a lot of homework. He will make you work hard to get an A in his class.

Also likes to use easy practice problems in class and leave you mentally unprepared for the quizzes/exams. He rarely shows much work when he does solutions for practice problems and tends to make the course more convenient for himself.
