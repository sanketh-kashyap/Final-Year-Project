It is a very ""old school"" type of class. Mr. Powis sits in front of the class and he goes over that day\'s lectures and you take notes on what he is saying. The tests are multiple choice. He also provides plenty of extra credit. The only thing is he MAY need a hearing aid, though! ;) JK, he is great!"

He sometimes goes off topic due to the questions the students ask. There aren\'t a lot of tests in that class too. His extra credit is to write 5 essays on whatever material you guys have gone over. Powis is just a really cool guy.

I had him for the three hour lecture, yet I still enjoyed the class. All his tests are multiple choice and he gives a lot of extra credit opportunity. READ the chapters, know the vocab, and take the end of chapter quizzes and you\'re guaranteed an A. I would take him again for sure."

The tests are multiple choice so that itself gives you an advantage, but still need to study (the vocab and self quiz at the end of chapters). His lectures are long, but interesting - sometimes. He\'s a great teacher. I recommend him for that class. Its a typical college class. You need the book."

He\'s in very funny and works with the class to make sure that you can best learn. He\'ll ask you, as a class, if you\'d rather test weekly, bi weekly or what have you. Love him"
