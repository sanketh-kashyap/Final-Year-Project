Juan  Duhart,University of Nevada Las Vegas,Biology department, Las Vegas, NV,4,4.8,N/A,2.0,,11,12/19/2013,BIOL304,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"JD is awesome! I had him for Genetics Discussion. He is a super funny guy. Classes were informative and entertaining. He does a good job of preparing you for the quizzes. The discussion manual is not that great (unless you love tables). Study what he says and Andres\' lecture notes. Quizzes were usually pretty easy. Mix of m.c., t/f and short answer"

JD\'s quizzes are very tough, but he goes out of his way to make sure that you understand. He uses a lot of helpful analogies that help you retain the information. I don\'t think I would have passed the lecture portion of the class if I hadn\'t taken advantage of office hour. Challenging but fair. A+"

I definitely recommend anyone to take his lab classes. It\'s almost impossible to not get an A if you study at least a little bit before the class. Teaches very well and is very helpful and kind. Take his class if you have a hard Prof. for the Biol lecture.

Always cracks jokes and made class easy and enjoyable. Compared with what other people have told me, he\'s one of the best T.A.\'s for Biol 189 lab. I would definitely take him again if I could!"
