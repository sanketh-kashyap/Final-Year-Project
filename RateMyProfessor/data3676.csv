Judy  Shaw,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,Public Health department, New Brunswick, NJ,0,1.8,N/A,3.5,,2,06/01/2009,PLCY400,2.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Judy Shaw definitely is a unique individual. Her methods of instrucion are eccentric and you can tell she hasn\'t spent her career in academia. I can see how some of her methods can cause stress for graduating seniors. However, if you need her for a reccomendation later on she will make a very serious effort on your behalf."
Judy  Shaw,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,Public Health department, New Brunswick, NJ,0,1.8,N/A,3.5,,2,03/04/2009,PLAN400,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Judy shaw should not be a professor. She moved the time of our class to early Friday morning to suit her own schedule. She instituted a dress code and wastes everyone\'s time with mindless exercises. She is the worst professor I have ever dealt with in 4 years at Rutgers. If you can take the internship with anyone else..MAKE SURE YOU DO!!
