During class, he just scrolls through the pdf on the projector and reads off of it. Sometimes he tries to get the class to participate by asking students to do problems on the board, but nobody know how to do it, so he ends up telling them what to write anyway"

He laughs at students every signal lecture for students\' lacking of perfect American accent, lack of full knowledge of this course, and so on. The thing is if we are perfect, we don\'t have to sit in his class! A very discouraging professor!"

At times, he can be a bit condescending, which is why I hesitated to ask questions. Work load is reasonable, but spend a lot of time on the homework because it\'s graded problem by problem. Can get a decent grade with some effort, but a lot more work to get an A."

Secretive about his material. Class problems are much easier than HW problems. HW is graded. Requires a lot of hardwork. But Midterms and finals were easy. Go for it. Secured an A easily ;).

Overall I think the class can be organized better if the material was provided with a better formatting instead of hand-written notes scanned as pdf. Not particularly bad but I will not be missing this class

Prof is old school,dry sense of humor, decent for a dry subject. Tricky tests tho. Class average on midterm was 64%. I usually get A\'s or A-\'s, but found studying for this exam tough. Not a lot to cover, but he does try to trip you up on questions. Overall he\'s okay."

If you do (and understand) the homework, you\'ll do fine on the exams."
