Also, if you want to keep up with your grade, he doesn\'t update it on eCampus until the day of the final. He also expects everyone to participate, and hold discussions that aren\'t really discussions."

Lecture is boring and really not worth going to but go to your discussion classes since you\'d probably learn more there and can actually stay awake.

A decent load of reading, no real HW except reading/studying/writing research paper. 1 midterm, 1 final, and 1 paper. Drops lowest quiz grade. Prof. Siekmeier did not use any visual aids which made class a bit boring, but he knows his stuff very well. Required books were quite interesting, worth keeping too."

Attendance is mandatory because he gives out pop quizzes often during class. There is only one midterm test and then a take home final. Def take him if you can!

The class is very easy especially if you are a bad test taker because there is only one actual test. There are three papers you have to write but he is a very fair grader and the final is take home. I would recommend him to anyone especially if you are bad at history like me.
