He talks the entire class though, but attendance is not mandantory and you can get everything you need to know out of the book. The tests are pretty hard for the character matching."

Study guides arent as they are on tests only about 1/4 of it makes it to the tests. If you participate in class you will do better than you should, kind of gives brownie points."

You have to memorize a map on the test which I got all C\'s on.. you do book critiques..EZ..and a movie review. Not big on grammer.. wasnt big on att. until people start taking advantage. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
