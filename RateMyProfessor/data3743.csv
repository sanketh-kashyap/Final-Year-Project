Tests are ridiculous even after studying for a week and a half and are pretty long.

Best finance class I have taken yet. I learned a lot in this class and the end of semester project helps you to put all of your investment management knowledge together and is a really good learning experience. Dr. Mobbs wants you to do well in his class but you have to try. Dr. Mobbs won\'t let you down! :)

You can tell that he is an intelligent man but it is hard to keep alert. All of his notes are online and he posts practice tests. I would recommend someone else but he is the only one who teaches this course. His area of study is managerial compensation but he\'s teaching investments.
