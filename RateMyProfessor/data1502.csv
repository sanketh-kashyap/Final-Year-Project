Then spend 3-4 hours studying it and it should be an easy A/A-. There is really no reason to go to lecture. I went to almost all and it was very boring and hard to pay attention. Go to section, fill out the study guide(some answers on quizlet), study and you are good to go."

Unfortunately, it\'s not for teaching. They somehow manage to make incredibly graphic, fascinating topics - human sacrifice! cannibalism! eating guinea pigs! - into the cure for insomnia. If they decided to record audiobooks instead of teach, they could finally solve a mental health issue that impacts millions."

The profs purposely talk in a monotone voice just to throw you off and then trick you into thinking the multiple choice tests will be easy when they ask questions about irrelevant and obscure details from the lecture. It is impossible to focus in class and the tests are on things that were not covered.

GSI\'s are rude and unhelpful. A GSI told me a wrong answer to an exam, and that was the difference between 2 letter grades. I spent more time studying for this class than I did for my MCDB classes, yet I got TWO letter grades below. There are NO notes or powerpoints. Each question on an exam is 2% of your grade. AVOID"

No textbook, no homework, and only 3 exams/quizzes that take 20 minutes to finish."

Just look at the study guide before the exam and you\'re guaranteed an A. To those interested in archaeology -- you won\'t learn as much as you\'ll want to but it\'s easy! I definitely recommend this class and both profs are soo nice."

I\'d recommend to anyone interested in Archaeology or Latin America."
