I love her and wish she wasn\'t gone! Very intimidating at first but worth the effort getting used to her. She\'s gone now due to having a baby.

Shes very caring and helpful.. So sad she wont be back to teach anymore

Gives a lot of feedback for care plans/ concept map. Leaves you alone during clinical but expects you to be very thorough when answering med questions while giving meds. Passed everyone in my clinical (thats saying a lot). Very good, highly recommend."
