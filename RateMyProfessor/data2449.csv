He can be a bit rude sometimes; I just try to catch him on his good days. Attend each class, you\'ll miss a lot! And take good notes. He allows you to record him, so do that as well. It will help for papers."

Doesn\'t post anything online like notes,or study guides Only a mimdterm,final,& research paper.This class was hard for me because there is so much info on the test since there are only two, and he doesn\'t go over at all what you need to know for them. He doesn\'t give you choices for the essay on exam either."
