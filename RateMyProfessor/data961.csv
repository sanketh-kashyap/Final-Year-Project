He gives the best feedback during our scenes and monologue that you have a clear idea on what to change, not just some abstract concept like most acting teachers. I adore him and the class, but it is a lot of work. Rehearse a lot and take risks and you\'ll do well"

I took his acting for the camera class, and I am pretty sure every single person in that class enjoyed all 2 and 12 hours we were in there everyday we had class. Matt is SO funny, and he knows what he is talking about. He is always open to hear others opinions and up for trying new things to benefit your acting! GREAT teacher!!"

His work sessions force you to better your performance in front of the entire class which is horrifying at first but is the best practice for taking a directors feedback on set. Come to sessions prepared or you\'ll just waste chances to better yourself as an actor.
