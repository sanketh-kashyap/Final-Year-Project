To the other commenters, she DID NOT get her position by riding on the coattails of others. She has a PhD from Princeton and has done incredible research on the Tale of Genji! Harvard doesn\'t tenure just anybody. She is NOT an ice queen. In fact, she is the nicest and most helpful professor I have had at Harvard."

She never actually *taught* anything, but instead let the students attempt the teaching, only to have our hazarded ideas or creative theories received by her trademark ice queen stare... or an occasional, ""Well, isn\'t that obvious?"" Absolutely useless and should NOT be a teacher."
