Knows his stuff, very personable, and discusses interesting topics that benefit you. I liked going to his lecture and he even gave an option of which type of midterm you would like to take (case study, multiple choice, or a combo of the two). If you do the work, it will pay off. Had him twice and I would def take him again."

You won\'t regret it."

Gives options of what kind of exam you want to take (multiple choice, essay, case study, etc.). TAKE THE CASE STUDY. At least don\'t take the mutliple choice. VERY DIFFICULT. It\'s the reason my grade was lower. I got A\'s on everything else including the research paper. Great professor! Wish he taught more classes"

Took this class, 21st Century Management Practices, online and loved it. Wasn\'t all that motivated when the class began but Dr. Joos makes it very interesting. He grade tough but appropriately. His quizzes and exams test you over the material you read in the text and they are fair indications of your level of understanding."

The instructor is very knowledgeable in this suject area and makes the class very fun and exciting. The only problem is that the exams are closed book and no notes. There is group paper, an article presentation and a presentation of the group paper. But all in all I would recommend this instructor."
