I ended up getting a B+ on the final!!"

It had been over 20 yrs since I had been in a math class and basically remembered very little algebra. I took an 8 week class which was fast paced but worked well for me. When she goes over new material she gives plenty of examples and will ask the following day if anyone had problems. Highly recommend her!

Mrs. Lee was extremely patient and helpful with the whole class. My son was having problems converting fractions to decimals and for once, I actually could help him with this problem, thanks to Mrs. Lee! She made Math fun for me, which it had never been before!"
