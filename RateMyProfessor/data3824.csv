She also seemed to go over some problems quickly or skip a few steps. She would answer questions we had and we always went over practice problems near the end of class which made the concepts much easier to understand.

At first it was very difficult to understand her but after the first few weeks I sort of started to understand what she MENT to say rather than what she was saying. I thought this class was easy. She tries hard to make sure everyone understands. She messes up a lot so you have to keep an eye out for that otherwise you\'ll be lost.
