John  Foust,University of Maryland University College,Criminal Justice department, Adelphi, MD,3,4.1,N/A,2.0,,6,11/17/2012,CJS120,1.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,I\'m not sure why everybody gave him such good reviews. The accelerated class is awful. A paper plus conferences every week (ontop of your other classwork. His paper directions on content are always vague yet he is full of critiques. Clear directions=Clear papers. He does not give clear directions yet excepts perfection.

I would recommend his class to anyone. Yes, he follows the syllabus to the T but he will work with you if you fall behind it is no reason you should get less than a B. GREAT PROFESSOR"

I enjoyed taking his class and I would take another course with him. Attendance was mandatory because was an online and you must participate on a weekly basis, as with most online courses. I am not sure what my grade is yet but I scored well on all assignments. I would recommend others to take his class. :)"
