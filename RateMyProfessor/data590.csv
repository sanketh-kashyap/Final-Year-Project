You know exactly what you will be tested and when we all didnt do super well on the first test she let has resubmit answers. There are in class quizzes every class but they arent too hard if you study flashcards and she ends up dropping a couple. She sounded WAY better than the other guy who teaches this class!

She is not mean, she just does not know what she is talking about. She reads from her slides. She is not very confident. The class is ridiculously easy though, you can pass without hardly trying. The level of group work is nauseating, and the activities don\'t teach you."

If you\'re looking for an easy A, take Ostraff for BIO 100. Final is made up of a bunch of easy writing assignments throughout the semester, and the tests are easy. Great class to take if you\'re trying to knock out a GE and boost your GPA. Class itself is kind of boring, but the easiness of it makes up for it."

This is what I hope for all generals at BYU. Gave a good overall grasp on biology in the world and how I fit into that.
