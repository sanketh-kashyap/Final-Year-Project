Alethea  Barbaro,University of California Los Angeles (UCLA),Mathematics department, Los Angeles, CA,2,3.1,N/A,2.6,,8,08/12/2012,PIC10C,1.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"She can\'t teach well. She\'s very unclear about what she wants, because frankly, she doesn\'t know what she wants, because she can\'t program well. This was her first time teaching 10C, and what a waste of my time it was. if you have another option Take CS 32 or 33 or whatever it is instead. You\'ll actually learn instead of study-teach from the book."

She made things clearer, and after taking it, the Big C++ book finally made sense, and I appreciated it more. I\'m going to miss her when she leaves for that awesome tenure track elsewhere. She wasn\'t a C++ master, but like, she did what she had to and she tried really hard for us. She\'s better at emails now. :)"

Her tests are now impossible. She fails everyone. She made the second midterm which was given on the 8th week, cover everything since the first day of class. She expects you to know proofs and definitions, which is unfair. Avoid this teacher if possible. Take Dai/Oberlin for an A!"
