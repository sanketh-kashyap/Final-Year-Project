He is tough, but straight forward. DON\'T be late or leave early for his class. He loves pop quizes when students are late or leave class early. He is more interested in you learning than you are. Knows his stuff!!"

His class is very enjoyable untill you have a quiz or a test because they are recall test instead of A B C or D, If you miss one part of the question or are slightly off, you get the whole question wrong."

He is more intersted in you passing the class than anything else... Im always late and have come in over two hours late at times with no penality. As long as you show up before class is dismissed you get credit. And the test are so easy!
