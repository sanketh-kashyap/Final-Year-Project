He is SO nice and looks like he REALLY enjoys teaching b/c you can tell when he gets frustrated when nobody wants to participate. He is always trying to engage people into his \'magic cirlce\' of class. Not a hard class at all if you keep up and just pay attention. DEFINITELY RECCOMMENDED!!!!

He is the perfect ethics professor. Really engages students and tries to get them to understand ethical issues. Intelligent, funny, and cares for each student. Very busy so you won\'t get feedback at a reasonable time... or at all, but if you put in the effort, you\'ll do well."

There was never a boring lecture. 10 4-question quizzes, drops lowest 2. Research paper with sections due throughout semester, very easy with choice of topic. Only negative thing is sometimes took long to return feedback on paper."

He\'ll chew the class out en masse if you collectively flub an assignment though so, do you and your classmates a favor and do it like he spells out almost step-by-step for you. When he\'s really into the subject, you may end up watching YouTube videos all class, which are always somehow on topic and helpful while fun."

His lectures were extremely interesting; he does his absolute to make sure everyone was interested. TIP: If you read the chapter reviews after every chapter and pay attention in class, then easy A."

He\'s pretty hilarious, so it makes you want to listen to what he\'s lecturing about, and he\'s able to relate what you\'re learning to real life experiences. I highly recommend"

Showed up to class sometimes 15 minutes late 2. Hands out 4 question pop quizes on readings from 2-3 weeks back 3. Having to read sometimes 40 pages worth of material per class (twice a week) 4. He has a bad attitude towards students 5. Never got back to my emails, claiming he had too many. I regret taking this class."

Hilarious at times, always interesting. It was a discussion class not a lecture class. The text-book reading wasn\'t madatory but helped for tests and papers. Easy homework. Again very interesting and my favorite class of the quarter."

He is very knowledgeable and is able to teach and communicate very well. This class was very easy, but at the same time I think this is in my top 3 of classes I learned the most. I also took Intro to Game Design with him which was much more challenge, but I recommend him at all cost. Def take his classes."

One of the coolest professors you\'ll ever get. Really interesting guy who is into the material. The class is not demanding, but you still walk away with a breadth of knowledge you didn\'t have before. Again, he\'s a G, #1 recommended teacher at depaul."

But the class itself was laidback yet interesting, with some great discussion. Nothing too terribly difficult, either."

The textbook also sort of sucks for the subject matter, but overall it was an enjoyable class. It would be much better if he would just return papers in somewhat of a timely manner so you have an idea how your doing in the course!"

Lots of reading but only 2 quizzes the whole quarter. Very slow at returning assignments. He has a good sense of humor and seem s to have led an interesting life!"

And while he is busy. He is always willing to help out his students. I got a B in his class only because of poor attendance. He\'s one of the best at DePaul. I would take him again.

Chauncey has so much going on in his personal life (design co, freelance writer, modeling) that you\'ll never get your papers back on time. The readings are really boring. In addition, you\'ll think that you\'re doing great only to get a C in the class."

His class is pretty easy,we had huge readings everyday which no1 did but everyone got 3/4 or 4/4 on the reading quizes. Class seems simple and u think ur doing good until he grades ur final paper. Did well all class long but the paper put me down to a B-. IDK. its a tough call."

I got a C in his class after putting so much work into it. Any one who says hes a good teacher obviously got a good grade on his impossible final paper because they had an easy topic. Oh and if you like reading 80 pages a week of tiny print endless PDF files then this is your guy. RUN RUN RUN, never again."
