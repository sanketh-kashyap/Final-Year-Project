English is my second language, but I had a good grade on this class. His voice is loud, I don\'t think he yells at students. He is nice."

Very arrogant. Yells at students for asking questions, has a fit if you want to see a graded test, unfair grading system, horrible handwriting but still handwrites all notes on board. Do not take this teacher!"
