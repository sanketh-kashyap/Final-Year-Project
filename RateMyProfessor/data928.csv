Most of your grade is made up of points from homework, which is usually way harder than what ends up being on tests."

He truly understands physics at a deep level, but tries to get you to answer the questions yourself. The book is used quite extensively, but is available in the library if you don\'t want to spend too much. He tends to free-associate and often goes off on a... tangent :P but he\'s a great guy and gives tons of Ex C!"

The biggest difficulty is in his instruction his approach to the topic is theory based. However, when it comes time for the exam it is all problem solving and very few theory questions. In class you spend little time with equations but that is all you are tested over."

I go to SLU and was expecting this summer stlcc class to be a joke, but it was challenging. He has your back, and if you put the effort in, you will do well. I was surprised that I actually liked his class and ended up learning a lot of interesting stuff."

He gets off topic & rambles on about the government, politics, etc. He offers a lot of extra credit, but gives a LOT more homework. He is nice and humorous at times, but is overall very overwhelming.

It was hard but Kinder always took time to help if anyone needed it (before and during class). He was also generous with extra credit and his grading policy, although that may have been due to difficulty of taking it during the summer. He did sometimes blabber, but it was always about the topic and was interesting."

The SCHOOL fails to explain that a solid base of Algebra would be a wonderful help with this class. Loved the class and professor!

He talks about nonsense all class. If your going to take his class you had better already have a firm grasp on physics. Though if you do, he does grade on a major curve, I think its because he either does not want to teach or does not know how."

He marks on the basis of home work assignments and tests. But he talks all useless in the class instead of teaching the subject matter. Infact, he talks more of useless things than teach in the class, and hurries at the end to complete the course. Think before you enroll in his class."
