Prof. Schafer is an extremely tough grader and often fails to communicate well with his students. Though he is generally a good person you may want to think before taking his class."

If you have never taken Spanish in High School and do not speak another language, then you may have a hard time in this class like I did, but he was always available and willing to help when I asked. Sign up for tutors early!!!!!"

If you have never taken Spanish class in high school or never heard of Spanish language then this will be a hard class for you. Since I took it in high school it was very easy for me and I never did the homework\'s. Take his class only if you are familiar with Spanish.

He took away my grade in my tests without reason and I just realized it when I reviewed for my final exam. He takes everything really serious so think carefully before you take his class.
