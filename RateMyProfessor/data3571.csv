Success is possible in this class just be sure to keep up on your sketchbook, don\'t turn in any late projects (no matter how tempting it is), show up to class (missing a class most likely means you\'ll miss an in class sketch). Mr. Chang is very helpful and knowledgeable just be sure to ask questions!"
