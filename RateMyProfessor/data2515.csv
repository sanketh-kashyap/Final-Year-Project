This class is extremely difficult if you have no interest in learning how to read music notes, or listen to songs and understand what notes they are playing. His only grading for the online course is by quizzes, so there is no way to boost your grade. You can not see which answers are wrong"

I really like his grading structure listed in his syllabus. The syllabus says: I count all work equally. That means the quizzes are just as important as the Discussion Board.
