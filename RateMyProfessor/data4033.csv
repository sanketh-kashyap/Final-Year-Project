Terrence  Lavin,Southern Connecticut State University,Art department, New Haven, CT,8,3.0,N/A,3.4,Skip class? You won\'t pass. (1),7,09/05/2017,ART233,5.0,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,Yes,A-,SKIP CLASS? YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,"My favorite art professor at scsu. He taught me a lot of new techniques and was always nearby if we had questions. Unlike other art forms, though metal working requires a lot of math and has certain elements that can\'t be subjective. If you go into the class with that in mind you\'ll enjoy it much more. Also get ready to sand for hours."

I would never take him again"

He RARELY offers a compliment, & is often demeaning to students (even though its beginners class). His condescending remarks about how easy something should be & how you\'re doing it wrong reinforce how insecure he must be, considering it\'s an ART class and it\'s supposed to be subjective"

He says you can certainly do the project, but fails to mention how ""tricky""the idea you\'re trying to manifest really is. He\'s super fun, but if you\'re foreign to metalworking, be prepared to spend a ton of time in lab hours."

For any troubleshooting - go in during lab hours. The lab tech is very knowledgable & helpful."

I also find art assignments odd. its art, im no good at being restricted with the creative process. i would not retake him as a prof but it also has been some years for both of us so things could be different. Also didnt enjoy working with brass and copper, ect."
