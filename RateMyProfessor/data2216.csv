I am currently enrolled in her Pharmacology class online and she is very helpful and responds to questions quickly. I emailed her to let her know that I will not be receiving my textbook in time to finish an assignment and she offered to let me borrow her textbook until I receive mine. Awesome professor! She really cares.

Having her for clinical professor was the most maddeningly unhelpful learnig experience I have ever had. Her lack of commitment to teaching is indicative of just how little Yuba College cares for their students and their students\' learning experience.
