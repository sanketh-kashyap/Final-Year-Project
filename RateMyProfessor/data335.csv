Paul  De Gennaro,Sacramento City College,Biology department, Sacramento, CA,3,4.8,N/A,3.0,LECTURE HEAVY (1)  Tough Grader (1)  Clear grading criteria (1),2,11/12/2015,BIOL430,4.5,2.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA  LECTURE HEAVY  TOUGH GRADER,2,0,"Very clear in what he expects & what will be on the exams. He\'s all about giving you tools you need to succeed on exams (which are grueling, but it\'s A&P... What did you expect?) & spelling out what\'s on exam. No EC, but easier grader comparatively from what I\'ve heard. Flipped class format. TIME CONSUMING! Don\'t take w/ another science lab class!"
