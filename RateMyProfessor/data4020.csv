If you do the work on time and submit everything and study for the exams you\'ll get an A. Good person, online assignments help boost grade. If you need help he offers it. Don\'t hesitate to contact him if you\'re struggling. I would take him for another class."

It\'s supposedly online, but he will attempt to hold exams in the Old Westbury campus, AT 8 AM!!! And he just assigns HW without even telling you how to do the problems. Dropped this course two weeks later. DON\'T TAKE!"

He doesn\'t work much with you on the grades and all the tests are scantron based. Know your definitions and you\'ll do great. Look over all slides (He only teaches from powerpoints which he uploads to blackboard). He also sounds like Kermit the frog. Good luck!

His class is all power-point slides and he speaks with an incomprehensible monotone, be prepared to fall asleep. Worthless teacher, all his tests have errors in the key, so ask him to go over any question you got wrong. Online quizzes help average. Taught the class to myself, do not take him if you need a solid foundation in chemistry!"

The whole course is on PowerPoint slides. You just have to download them from the BlackBoard and then study it at home. Attendance in class counts for 10% so come with your computer to play. 4 quizes (7.5% each) at home (BlackBoard) and 4 exams (15% each) including the final
