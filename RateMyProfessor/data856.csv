Lectures are boring, he just presents a powerpoint every class that he also posts online afterward. He sends around an attendance sheet at the end of every class. Basically had to teach myself all of the material but he is available if you need him."

Extremely smart and always available to help students. Although the class is challenging, if you work hard you will end up with a good grade. I definitively recommend him."
