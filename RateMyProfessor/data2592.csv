It is difficult to follow her lectures and to sit through her lectures as her voice is very monotone. Switch out as soon as you can, you will regret it if you don\'t. She expects way too much fro the exam."

We seem to be watching a video which is based on one of the stories we\'re reading \'Agamemnon"". She reads in monotone and at an very slow rate which is irritating to follow. Probably won\'t last until the second hour of this class."

When I requested extra notes + clarification (which I am entitled to and she must respect) she accused me of lying and said I obviously skipped her class. I never missed a single class. Also her voice is terribly lulling and she isn\'t very good.

As for the exam it was hard but not overly.

I wish I would have dropped this. After seeing what she expected on the exam, I nearly died. She expects way too much from a first year class and tries to cover way to many texts."
