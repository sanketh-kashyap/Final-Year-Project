ALWAYS GO TO DISCUSSION! Midterm and assignment was easy; the study guide for the final was very long so make sure you study both study guides; the final went over topics that didn\'t even seem important to the class.

One assignment and everyone did poorly because the rubric was not made until they graded the work (how stupid).I just took the exam and half of the questions were missing and they decided to double up points instead of grade the questions given adding extra points to the questions they forgot to add.
