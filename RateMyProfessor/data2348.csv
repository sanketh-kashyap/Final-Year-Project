Makes class very interesting. I went on to take other Anthro classes but I was disappointed to find that no other professor could compete."

She is funny so class was interesting. Only warning: lots and lots of reading for homework and questions to respond to. You will have reading quizzes once a week and for the final she gives you 70 possible questions that will be on the exam... but only puts 10 on it.. annoying"

Gives quizes on the readings whenever she wants as a way of forcing attendance. There are quite a lot of readings from books and articles. The end project was not demanding even though I was in a 5 person group. She gave away the questions for the midterm and final in the review sheet. Overall easy.

Takes attendance/gives reading quiz almost every class. Project is hard to do with so many people. Tests are annoying, all short answer and only gives credit for answers she likes. Gives you review sheet with 70 questions, only puts a couple on actual exam."

Goes through lecture a bit fast, but if you use your laptop to take notes, you should be fine. Readings are usually easy, quizzes in discussion are guaranteed 100s if you do the sheets on the readings. Tests were a bit annoying, 70+ questions to study for 10 or so questions, but overall easy and good class."

There was no real textbook, all we did was read articles and exams were 7 short answer questions based on a review sheet of 70 possible questions. The information was dry and too broad to get much out of. It was not hard, but the class could have been organized better. Gen-eds should not be this time consuming."

Presented information through slides and a few movies but mostly vocally. The slides could be more organized but she\'s pretty clear. I had her for her first time teaching the course so she\'ll hopefully be better in the future.

Good general education course to take, and only requires a little bit of work and light reading. Easy A with just a tad bit of studying. Highly recommended."
