Completely disrespectful to all of her students. Talks bad about the country and thinks she is better than everyone. Awful at teaching she thinks you should already know it and if you dont she thinks you are stupid. I will never take her again I would rather teach myaself.

This school has blocked most of the ""best"" websites so being able to go to her is very helpful. She is very ""handy"". It is more difficult now that there is another professor in her office. Who knows, maybe one day I can have them both at the same time. Her body is so amazing. I love her so much."

The main reason I got an A in the class (Calc II) was that I went to her extra help a lot. If you do all the homework (which there is a lot of) and make sure you understand it, you will do very well... she had a 3+ hour review session the sunday night before the final."
