She assigns a lot of work but trust me, she is a very fair grader. She clearly understands how an online class works and that is very important. The class has a diverse array of assignments including wiki project, short paper etc. I think she\'s great and I\'d recommend taking her. Don\'t take Ko, she\'s obnoxious."
