The class was one of the easiest I\'ve ever taken, all you had to do was study the definitions he gave us for the final. He marked our presentations really easily. He marks essays and exams harder."

Students taught ALL of the course material. (what is a professor needed for?) This didn\'t seem right. Presentations everyday and this is how we learnt material. Extremely boring, but marks were also given for attendance so this made it hard to miss class. Could lean just the same from reading text."

The class was interesting if you like Sociology. The only problem is that your marks do not reflect your work. I felt like I aced the final(I went in with high 80s), yet when I got the exam back he had marked it very hard. (Ended up in the 70s) Just write a lot and very thoroughly for the final and you will be fine."
