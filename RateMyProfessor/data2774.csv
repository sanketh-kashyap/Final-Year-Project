PARTICIPATION MATTERS  TOUGH GRADER,0,1,"What a joke. This professor turned a biology lab into something way more difficult than it needed to be. Made absolutely no sense when explaining anything. On top of he had no idea what the hell he was talking about. The class overall was easy, but i recommend taking it with somebody who actually knows the material."

Any questions I had he would explain in great detail. As long as you put in an effort and show up for class you will receive a good grade.

It is a beginners class but he teaches like a upper level. On a test his curve has to be massive because his test do not even go with the book.Its a class that I did not learn much and question were only answered depending on the person.

If this is a class that you have to take but dread it I recommend this professor!

Engineers the tests & grades based on what he thinks you deserve. Curves heavily because very few understand his lectures. When asked for help, states that ""it is not his fault if you can\'t comprehend the material"". Did not give attendance/participation points and group presentation is mandatory not EC as stated."
