She\'s a very tough teacher and grades hard. The tests are hard because the powerpoints and lectures and study guides are just so full of a ton of info for just a 50 question test. She gives a lot of homework and assignments to help keep your grade afloat if you fail the tests. You have to be fully dedicated to this class.

It\'s not an easy A but the teacher isn\'t to blame if you do bad she explains everything and gives you study guides and an extra credit opportunity. Overall I would definelty take her again

It\'s up to the student how well you do in this course by that I mean how well you pay attention,your attendance, and your studying habits. She was a GREAT teacher and fair"
