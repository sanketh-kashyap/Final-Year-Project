Homework and practices are an optional half letter grade increase! Concepts on practices are the same on tests, you get full credit on tests if you work problem correctly but have wrong answer!"

Kim will give you a run for your money and an B at best, Just will make you work but your B for sure, or A is guurrenteed."

Hard to understand his accent, doesnt teach the material he puts on tests, and doesnt offer extra help. I took him and got a D then retook chem again and got an A. what was the difference? i had a good teacher the second time around. do not take him unless ur already amazing in chem and dont need things explained"

With that said, trust me when I say do not take this teacher. If your an honors student you will have no choice but to teach yourself the book because the words that come out of his mouth in class are meaningless. Great guy nice personality, definitely knows his stuff but cant teach. AVOID!"

His class is not easy but if you work hard and understand everything he will be fair with the grading at the end....I highly reccomend him over any organic chemistry teacher at RCC

Hes kind of hard to understand in class, but if you go to his office hes really helpful. Chemistry is hard no matter what teacher you have, so you do have to work pretty hard to get an A."
