She put out the time and extra step to help students understand concepts of lecture. Exams were fair, multiple choice and short essay. Material is difficult but do-able if you put forth the time and effor to study."

This is her first class and I think she is teaching at more of a graduate level. She has a PhD and perhaps she is in upper division mode. If you think you will take this class and get an A, you will have to commit your life to this class. Good Luck. I would probably take someone else."

If your expectation to get an ""A or B"" good luck. Unless you don\'t work and have no kids and take this class only then maybe a ""B"". not a joke."
