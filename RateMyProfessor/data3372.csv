She was so enthusiastic and engaging with her lecture/discussion, and clearly was very interested in both learning and teaching, which rubbed off onto students. Difficult tests and material, but with the right effort, the class is definitely worth it!!"

Tests are hard but She is always willing to answer questions and explain concepts. She encourages her students to think outside the box. I was lucky to have her as a teacher. Difficult to get an A, but not impossible."
