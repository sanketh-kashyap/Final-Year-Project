Puts you on the spot in front of the whole class, and makes you feel stupid if you don\'t know the answer the her completely obscure question. Gets off topic and rambles. Gets frustrated if you ask her to repeat a question. You will not learn anything in her class because she is horrible at teaching."

She would spend 1/2 the class talking about her own opinions on government. She talked badly about a girl when she walked out of the classroom. And she gave tests that weren\'t even similar to the review.She would edit the syllabus every day(verbally) and argue with the students about due dates.

Her teaching skills are poor, which is to say nonexistent. Read the book and you\'ll know more than she does about govt or US hist. Don\'t dare have an opposing opinion because all she wants is ""facts"", unless she agrees with you. Bottom line if you have a choice, DO NOT pick her as your teacher."

Ms. Collymore is extremely boring, and kinda rude. She is really vague so you don\'t know what to study. She gets frustrated when you ask questions. She worships the textbook. Also, she seems to think everyone knows as much as she does about government."
