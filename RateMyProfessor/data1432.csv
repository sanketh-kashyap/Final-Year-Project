I\'ve used all that he has taught me time and time again. I can still hear that southern accent repeating and repeating the same thing over and over again. Thanks Professor Li. You made me get my monies worth from CSUF

But, I have to admit that Prof. Li was one of the best teachers that I have ever had... no matter what other people say... he motivated his students to not only memorize stuff but actually LEARN :)People don\'t like him, because they wanted him to pass them without putting any efforts... Wish you the best Prof. Li"

But all his toughness paid off in the end when I studied. You need to show up, take notes, and study. Very possible to pass. He\'s retired though so nothing more to say."

Not much to say anymore, he retired at the end of Fall 09 semester. He is tough but he just wants every one to be as good an accountant as he is. He doesn\'t deserve all the criticism from other commenters. Do the reading, there are no shortcuts in accounting (and life). Enjoy retirement Prof. Li."

He makes you read the Wall Street Journal, and is is on the exams. The only way to get a B in the class is to take the class twice. DO NOT DO THAT TO YOURSELF! STAY AWAY FROM HIM!!!"

He is actually entertaining and I enjoyed his sarcasm. Just pay attention in class and follow directions. When he tells you to stop answering questions - stop and you\'ll do fine. I pulled a B because of his curve. Very fair.

He always complains about class participation even though the class is participating. Hes the kind of professor that on tests will put a none of the above or two of the above on every question. We all read his profile on here and didnt think it was he was that bad... he is as bad as it says on here.

I\'ll also pay $$$ for the old midterm."
