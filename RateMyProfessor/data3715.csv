He challenges you to put yourself out there, to open up and realistically look at yourself in terms of sexuality. I am so thankful I got his last class at CCP. Wonderful instructor as well as a beautiful person."

Extremely helpful and knowledgeable with all his classes. Dr. Gould uses his class time very wisely and can be somewhat humurous. I definitely recommend any of his subjects/classes. Phenomenal teacher.

Smart, funny, well spoken, engaging and a true professional in the field. Has high expectation and will not accept excuses or tardiness, but efforts will be rewarded. The more you open up, verbally and mentally, the more you will get out of class. Teaches about individuals, societies, history and international sexuality issues."
