If you want to do well, go to griffin. I\'m a good student and it was sad to see me get a B in a class where an A should have been given. I did not learn enough from lectures. He was a bit behind most of the time. Also, others plz post reviews. Let\'s all try to help each other. We all know that grades r very Important"

At the beginning of the semester there were 70 people attending his class. By the end there was about 30 or less. Everyone starting attending another professor\'s lecture. Unless you are very good with chem. Don\'t take him.

Will is kind of funny, and is straight forward with what is needed to do well in the class. The info is hard, but as long as you get the basic concepts, listen to the lectures and study for the tests, you\'ll be okay. I say he\'s a great professor. He\'s not bad to look at either :)"

The lectures are completely on powerpoint which he goes over much too quickly for you to gain any useful knowledge, tests are incredibly hard and the paper was useless. Don\'t take him if possible!"
