Though this listing says that he teaches at UGA, he now teaches at Georgia Tech, and he made my experience very enjoyable. His grading criteria are INCREDIBLY clear, his website and calendar is impeccable, and he is a very fair grader. Great guy, too!"

The subject was political blogging, so it was a different kind of writing, but I can tell he would be great at teaching any English course. So glad I had him."

He tries to keep the class interesting because he has a passion for poetry. I really did learn a lot from him. Cares so much about the sudents and grades pretty easily! Highly recommended!

No matter how bad you stink at writing (like me), he is constantly encouraging and always gives great tips on how to improve. He is also a gentleman full of giggles."
