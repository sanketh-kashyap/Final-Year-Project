If you read the material, make your weekly forum posts, and do the few assignments, you will pass with flying colors. Extremely fair grading, workload, and expectations.

Why test us on chapters that we didnt go over as a class yet?? we finally go over ch 7-12 AFTER the midterm. pointless. he\'s a lazy professor who doesn\'t know how to teach. he just assigns work and gives credit. should have his Doctorate degree revoked."

While it is true that his participation points are as easy as writing and responding to weekly Discussion Boards and two 100 word article reviews, his tests were difficult and required reading 10 ch.\'s for a 2 hour test; that is next to impossible to memorize. DB\'s are thought provoking, interesting over all."

He sprang the whole midterm on us a week before we had it. It was very hard. It is open book and you get 2 hours. But man you need at least 3hrs. It covered more than half the book. He didn\'t even give a midterm review. Skip this teacher!

The tests are open book and the professor would tell us it would be from ch 9 to 18 (which is A LOT!) BUT the test would actually be from ch 1 to 22!! I thought it was unfair. Don\'t take him.
