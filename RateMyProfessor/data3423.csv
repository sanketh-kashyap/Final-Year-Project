Rose  Esquivel,Central Piedmont Community College,Nursing department, Matthews, NC,2,4.0,N/A,2.0,,2,04/27/2011,NUX5901,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"She is a wonderful person and can teach so that everyone understands on ANY level. Yes, she might have a mouth with a few words some might find offensive at times, but that is her personality and makes her real. It is not an act nor a show. She is a LIVE, ACTION, HANDS ON teacher and not everyone can handle this teaching style. Breath of fresh air!"

She\'s trying to hard to be ""cool"" Cursing alot during class doesn\'t make you a good instructor. Take time to teach, and stop trying to be cool."
