Still don\'t like it but look foward to this class every week. He has helped me actually understand chem. Never thought in a million yrs I\'d be getting an A but thanks to him I am.

So thankful I got Mr.Denise! Because of him, I have a newer understanding and love for Chemistry! He is a bit random at times but that is what makes his class so much fun! He will make sure you understand everything before you leave class! He\'s also got a GREAT haircut!"
