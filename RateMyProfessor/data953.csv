He gets annoyed very easily with students. Definitely a tough grader, no matter how hard you try he wont give you a good grade even if you deserve it. His way of teaching is not bad, but I don\'t recommend him. He takes things personal."

He may seem a little strict at first but he is really understanding. He has no problem stopping from continuing a lesson to explain further details about a subject if needed. His tests are all online and you\'re given several days to complete them. He\'s funny and makes class interesting.
