Meredith  Tweed,Seminole State College,English department, Sanford, FL,1,3.7,N/A,3.8,,10,05/04/2010,ENC1102,4.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Professor Tweed is a little tough but this is college after all. She is a great woman who really loves the material she teaches. If you liked to be challenged this is the class for you. If you are a slacker and want an easy A don\'t take. This class really prepares you. I recommend.
