Pooja  Lakshmin,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,Management department, Newark, NJ,5,4.3,N/A,1.6,,5,04/04/2014,NEUROOFSEX,3.5,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,B,,0,0,Her class is easy but it\'s hard to stay captive by her lecture. There doesn\'t seem to be a structure for the course that reflects a definitive theory around neuroscience and human sexuality. Much too much literature out there for this class to lack as much.

MAterial isnt too hard slightly tricky but she is helpful. I think she curves. Goes over the material in an interactive manner and has facebook so look her up.
