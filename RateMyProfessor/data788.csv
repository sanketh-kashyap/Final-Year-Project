She definitely gets the college writing process across. She can be a bit intimidating, but she encourages using her office hours a lot. Reading the syllabus is a must in her class."

Expect a ton of reading and revising. She is a tough grader, but not impossible to please. I definitely recommend visiting office hours or she will not care much for you."

She is very clear in class but i have no interest in history. Not the nicest but not too hard

Having said that I do believe she pushed every student to do the best that they could and her lectures were always to the point and incorporated class discussion flawlessly with them"

She stands as a professor who understands that students are fantastic resources for one another, and really wants them to be able to illuminate one anothers\' experiences. She is great at starting discussion and knowing how to be involved just enough to keep the discussion on track."

Great at stimulating discussion and conversation - I\'ll hopefully get a chance to take her again. A fair amount of work but you\'ll get a lot out of the class. Great at answering questions and encouraging all sides of a debate.

Definitely take a class with her if you can. Her classes are a fair amount of work for sure but I think its worth it. Knows so much about history, especailly womens history."
