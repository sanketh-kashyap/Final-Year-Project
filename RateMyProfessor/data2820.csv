YOU WON\'T PASS.  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"he can be very curt with how he words things, but he never says something that isn\'t right per say. Difficult grading makes you really work for it and it\'s super rewarding when you nail an assignment. He remembers you specifically and gives specific advice and examples to look at as an artist. Straight forward, I take classes he teaches still."

Homeworks are a lot of work &require a lot of time in the studio outside of class. I took him 2 semesters in a row because my skills really did improve, and it\'s because of how structured his class is."

Don\'t let his attractive face fool you, the man is there to teach and you will be taught. I personally struggled in his class, but he provided a drawing tutor for us to meet with every other day. He is a tough grader and you MUST participate in critiques, he also gives homework and a test. Just give it your 110%."

That being said, if you actually put the time in, and you actually listen to what he has to say when he\'s trying to help you, you will do good. I used to use a tracer at my highschool to draw and he taught me how to draw completely from scratch. I loved this class, I wish I had him again. Plus he\'s cute :)"

He was extremely rude and not personable at all. He was the toughest grader which was very frustrating. dont expect to get anywhere close to an A in the class..good luck to who ever takes his class."
