Suzanne  O\'Brien,Boston University,History department, Boston, MA,1,3.7,N/A,2.5,,6,11/05/2010,WRI100,2.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Prof O\'Brien is a nice lady with good intentions but for as for teaching a writing course, she was completely useless. Her prompts were repetative and poorly explained. She\'s always scatterbrained and constantly says ""um"" in order to gather her thoughts. Average class, shes more annoying than anything, readings arent required, 3 papers, its alright"

She\'s really smart and knows her subject and she\'s really animated and excited to be there. I loved her. She was a little harsh with the grades but I could have tried harder. Never once was mean or rude and was relatable on a personal level. I felt like if I had a problem, I could go talk to her."

Professor o\'brien is a hysterical, enthusiastic new professor with a wealth of knowledge about japanese history. i had absolutely no interest in the topic when i signed up for her class, but she cared so much about Japan that it caught on. plus, she helped me graduate early."

She has a good sense of humor and treats her students like adults: you are expected to come to class and to do the readings. Your grades will come primary from the quality of your papers, which require outside research."

If you are into the subject matter, she can make it stimulating albeit a little condescending. However, she just needs to have tests because without them you don\'t have to go to class."

She constantly uses the word ""like"". As in, like, she talks like a total, like, twelve year-old girl. Often, she will employ air quotes with her fingers, sometimes with respect to words or phrases that have no possible need for air quotes. No exams in the class, making the readings pointless..."
