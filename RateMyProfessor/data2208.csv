He really cares about his craft and I highly recommend him if you are a kinesthetic learner. Van McElwee knows his stuff. Also listen really close because he has a very subtle sense of humor and it\'s hilarious.

He knows his craft and has interesting projects and speakers for class. You\'ll learn a lot and have fun doing it, which makes the learning that much easier. It was a 4 hr class, but it flies by. I hope I can fit more classes with him in the future. The book is dull, but do the readings because the discussions are short."
