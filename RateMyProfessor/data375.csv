His readings jump around, and so do his lectures. He asks questions about the book that we haven\'t read yet and gets mad when we don\'t know the answer. His stutter makes it hard to keep up and his power points make no sense. The TA is great and is probably the only reason I will understand the material."

Lectures in a very jittery roundabout manner. Have to rely on TA to answer your questions, grading is especially more stringent on exams than it is on written assignments. Encourages participation. You will not do will on exams if you don\'t read all the material."
