Difficult grader, because she wants everyone to write in her own style, not realizing that writing is a creative art that everyone does differently. Readings never end, and you rarely even discuss them in class- but you have to read them anyway for the off chance that she brings them up. If you\'re thinking about taking her, dont"

DO NOT DO IT! As a pre-med major, I thought epidemics in american history would be interesting. The class is a lot of reading, participation, and even though there\'s only 4 papers, THEY ARE HARD! I would say avoid this class at all costs."

However, there is a lot of writing involved."

SHe is really dedicated to her work. However, she isn\'t very helpful in her office hours, and that becomes a problem when you need to write a research paper (you\'re basically writing without much guidance). The TA was very helpful though."

She is an endless source of knowledge and you can tell that she is excited to share that with you. I would take her race and health class again if I could. The class is almost completely based on articles and class discussion.
