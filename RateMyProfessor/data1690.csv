Gotta watch movies to do reports-can work with someone for this. No acting required. Required to go to school plays. Seems understanding and helpful. Easy A if you\'re willing to watch the school plays and a couple of movies on your own (moulin rouge, death of a salesman, etc)"

She wastes a good chunk of time trying to adjust the sound tiny videos clip that she shows the class. She does not specify the amount of info expected in her assignments. Overall she is does not have passion in teaching as she is quiet vague in all explanations
