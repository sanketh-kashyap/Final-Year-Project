LOTS OF HOMEWORK  TOUGH GRADER,2,1,Mr. Goodbar is a nice teacher but it\'s very unclear what he expects at times. His lectures are very long and very boring. Lost interest in the class first few days. His test are very hard and labs are not so bad. You have to attend class if you want to pass. If given a redo of the class I would drop it and taken someone else.

EXTRA CREDIT,1,1,Bio 21 can be very tough if you don\'t put in the effort and come to class (especially for labs you can\'t make them up). He is an easy grader on labs as long as you complete them. Tests are multiple choice with a written page that is fully based on lecture notes so you must come to class to get the notes! The book is mainly used for pictures!
