Oshika  Whittaker,CUNY Queens College,Education department, Flushing, NY,1,1.8,N/A,4.3,,7,08/21/2010,SEYS1149,1.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I think Professor Whittaker really tried, but I think she is just too inexperienced to be teaching a Secondary Education class; especially when she can barely conduct a class herself. Her lectures consist mostly of flipping through PPoint slides and you really don\'t learn anything by the time the semester is over. DO NOT TAKE !"

Unclear, unsure of answers and has no practical experience in Middle or High school classrooms. You will learn nothing that will help you in your class room from this incompetent who is oddly a hard grader considering that she knows so little herself. Thinks teaching is reading PowerPoint slides verbatim."

She doesn\'t even deserve the title since the students did most of the teaching. She offers no guidance or support and you find out your grades when it\'s already too late to do anything about it! Horrible horrible horrible!!!!!!!!!

She doesn\'t happen to enjoy lecturing much, considering student presentations dominated most of the semester. Secondly, she is not concerned with students\' success at all, which is quite ironic since, she teaches about what teachers could do to raise children\'s academic success. WNR."

But you should be careful since she is strict. You must study her notes to get anywhere, textbook won\'t help much. You must do presentations as well."
