He plays music before every class. If you miss class, notes are up on Carmen. He\'s very understanding when it comes to certain things and great to have a conversation with. You can really tell he\'s excited about teaching and history is one of his favorite subjects. Debates in class were one of my favorite things we did."

He does clear his throat quite a bit though and has a Boston accent but once past that, he is easy to understand. Lots of reading but class discussions really help for clarity. Definitely recommend him."

His class is really easy, except for the mult choice exams which have trick questions on them. You will learn alot and do alot of discussing during class."
