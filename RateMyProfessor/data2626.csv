She changes the syllabus almost every class, assigns way to many reading assignments (Even though its a production class there\'s no need for reading) and has been 40 min late more than once"

I went into Documentary Production with little idea of what to expect, but I found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences I ever had at Emerson. The work was challenging, but I never got bored, and always felt like I was breaking new ground. She was ridiculously supportive of everyone and their work."

She blends her own professional experience with her unique and honest personality to create such a satisfying environment for the creative minded student. She openly cares about every student\'s vision and potential more than any professor I\'ve ever had.

Go see her after class, she is more than willing to help with anything you need. She goes above and beyond most instructors to help out. Because of Julie, I landed a great internship, which turned into an amazing job. She\'s a good lady to know!"

She is definitely more suited to teach Documentary Production, and it\'s actually my favorite class this semester. Documentary is Julie\'s main field, and we\'re actually getting real world experience and doing really cool projects. The class is laid back but structured."

I\'m usually pretty tolerable with professors, but Julie is just not meant to teach. She changed the syllabus multiple times and was really outdated. She was unorganized. I would say most of the students in the class knew more than she did about what she was teaching. Please heed advice, you won\'t regret it."

I think she realizes how jam-packed the syllabus is and that we can only do so much in such a limited amount of time. She\'s starting to treat us like the professionals we aspire to be.

She seemed really nice on the first day of class, but everything went down hill after that. She doesn\'t always explain herself clearly, and she can be condescending. If you know what you\'re doing, your intelligence may be insulted. If you don\'t know what you\'re doing, you\'ll probably be insulted anyway."
