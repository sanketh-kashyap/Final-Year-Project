Thomas  Dawson,United States Naval Academy,Engineering department, Annapolis, MD,5,1.7,N/A,3.0,LECTURE HEAVY (1)  Get ready to read (1)  SO MANY PAPERS (1),3,10/13/2014,EN441,1.5,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,GET READY TO READ  LECTURE HEAVY  SO MANY PAPERS,0,0,Professor Dawson should have probably remained an engineer rather than a professor at the Naval Academy. He lacked teaching skills and seemed more interested in telling us about the books and articles he had authored. I would not recommend his class to anyone unless you like being bored and you really don\'t want to learn anything.
