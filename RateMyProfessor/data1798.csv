Reads directly off notes which are copied from the book. Has heavy accent, difficult to understand, and confuses concepts in class. Problem sets are horribly written so don\'t really help. Read the book and you can answer her simple questions on the exams."

I really like the material but she makes it incredibly hard to pay attention. Buy the asuc notes, you will need them."
