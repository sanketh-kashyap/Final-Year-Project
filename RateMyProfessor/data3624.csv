This is what chem102 do as well. Just read the book and do the home work, you will succeed in her class easily. Overall, she is a easy professor. I really appreciated her."

She tells you that you failed her class with a big smile. She quizzes you in all discussions while she should ""discuss"" the material. Her quizzes are hard as hell and her tests are even harder. Homework is due every week & she\'s a hard grader."

Her exams are challenging, her quizzes are harder than her exams and there is homework due every week. She does NOT teach ANY concepts but the test is 50/50 on concepts and problem solving. She made her final exams out of pure AP Chemistry (collegeboard) exam questions... I would recommend but much studying is required."

Although she speaks English there is a bit of a language barrier. The course was slow at first but picked up towards the end. All in all she was an average professor."

Does all work n board to explain concepts. very kind and takes time to answer all questions to make sure you understand. Custom txbk fully used and reviewed in class. fair exams just make sure to read everything in the book and review bk/in-class calculations. attd not req but it\'d b wise Def. would recommend.

She will answer all your questions. however she is one of the most difficult and unfair graders i have ever had. if you end up having her class study a lot and check all your problems before turning them in.

She has a great deal of energy and she is not afraid to use it. Don\'t ask her questions that are lame! She remembers EVERYTHING!

Her lectures, if she even gives one, are unclear and unfocused. If I didn\'t want to have a lecture, I would have taken an online class. I was excited to take biochem and this class has been very disappointing."

Drew half of the structures wrong so lectures weren\'t reliable. Asks more questions about gen bio/gen chem and ochem than biochem , so if you don\'t remember them , you are screwed. Lies about materials that won\'t be on the test but appear on the tests. Some of her wordrings for answers are very ambiguous"

Everything on the test is from her notes. The book is helpful to read just to clarify things. She\'s always available during office hours. The extra chapters she gave weren\'t even covered in detail, it was very general so stop whining. She only did that to give you a basic idea of the whole subject. NO MATH PROBLEMS ON EXAMS! Awesome!"

She will not aswer questions and her tests were different from the lectures and textbook. She will explain balancing equations and go over it but she will only explain the basic and easy problems ahe will not explain the breakage of a compound I was able to pass her class ""c"" by going to tutoring and another chem 100 class"

I\'m still taking the course but so far the tests have been easy and her lectures helpful. You can\'t just rely on lectures to pass a test and students are obviously doing just that.

If you don\'t have a good background in chemistry/biology don\'t take this class. I got an A on every exam - highly recommend her."

She refuses to answer questions in class. You must teach yourself the material and she adds 5 CH. not required . She is the worst prof ever taken. I will NEVER take a class with her again.

DO NOT TAKE HER if you need high GPA for medical school

I would definitely take her again. You\'ll have to work hard for an A, but it is definitely doable. The built in curve makes anything above an 85% an A. Tries really hard to prepare you for the department final exam. She even brought it into class the week before the test and told us exactly what to study. Very reachable. Recommend."

I am a A student got C in her class. She is lier too. she said she will do curve but she did not. NO CURVE. she lies too much. Lecture is confusing and you will not learn anything in class. half of class dropped in first 2 weeks. Horrble teacher. DO NOT TAKE HER.
