The only reason why I go to class is because Dr Brown teaches it. Would strongly recommend Dr Brown."

It\'s surprisingly difficult subject matter, but Sandra knows her stuff and will try her best to make sure you know it too. She\'s super entertaining, especially when she\'s failing to remember someone\'s name. Do the homework, go to the labs, you\'ll be all right."

The labs are easy and so are the exams if you understand the concepts and done the practice exams. The lecture slides give minimal information so definitely jot down the notes she writes in class - which can be all over the place but they do help a lot.

Cares about her students and is extremely helpful. First week of class tells her students to call her Sandra. This class is actually taught by many other guest profs, but she helps out with questions about their assignments. Take SOIL 200 before this course. It will help you alot."
