That doesn\'t mean he should teach. I don\'t deny his genius, but I am not fond of his methods. The rehearsal room is supposed to be a safe place. I felt it to be a courtroom. Listen to him, but don\'t let him kill your spirit or love of acting. I learned that the hard way. There are amazing directors out there that do support"

He is manipulative beyond appropriate levels, unwilling to admit mistakes, and should not be allowed to direct."

I am not terribly interested in performance, but this class certainly piqued my interest quite a few times. Weekly moodle assignments, which he does not provide much feedback on. Grades too harshly on oral presentations. Extremely knowledgeable and accomplished."

He expects lots of work and dedication from his students. If you are willing to work hard and take criticism well, you will thrive with him as a professor. He really, really knows his stuff, and is one of the best teachers I have ever had. I learned an incredible amount from him. Plus, he\'s hilaaaarious."

He\'s willing to meet with you in office hours to help with everything from computer troubles, to paper, to general advisement. Great advisor. Would be behind schedule for graduation if not for his advice. He\'s tough, but if you do what he asks, which isn\'t over-expected, you\'ll do fine. VERY interesting classes som"

This is an amazing class and David is super passionate about the material which really shows. compared to a lot of other classes it isn\'t that bad, especially since its to TEACH you to WRITE better."

Hours of listening to musicals every week, plus weekly papers, plus long term papers, plus multiple chapters of reading out of 3 or 4 textbooks a week. Maybe it\'s just me but, DONT TAKE THIS HP COURSE. America and it\'s Musicals."
