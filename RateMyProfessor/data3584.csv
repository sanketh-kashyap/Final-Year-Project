He gives you the grade you earn and he makes you learn the material. If you just want to just get though Chem, take someone else. If you really want to learn and know it, take Buboltz. He\'s helpful. Go see him during office hours. Hard class but good pay off."

If you can take gen chem 2 with him I highly recommend it! He is also a nice guy to talk to outside of class and asks about your interests. An overall good professor!

Difficult and can be intimidating. But if you want to succeed he will do everything he can to help you. Attend class and labs. Definitely see him if you are struggling even though he can be super intimidating.

This was the first class I\'ve had to work at, but it was completely worth it. Def go to his office hours, not only for help, but just to talk and learn about more than just the material in class. TAKE WHENEVER POSSIBLE!!!"
