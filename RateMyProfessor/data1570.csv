She did not focus on the subject and wanted to discuss her personal life. She was not professional. She was not consice in her directions for assignments or did she properly review us for tests

I\'m a CJ minor so I know my stuff, but I felt as if she was more interest in Psychology than CJ. I felt uneasy about the tests but I always did fine. I\'m one that needs a review and it made me nervous to not receive one!She\'s a nice person but not a good teacher."
