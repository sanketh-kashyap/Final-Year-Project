Bad class time management. Evidently had to cut out activities all the time due to her own ramblings and tangents. Doesn\'t answer questions properly.

If she doesn\'t like you, she will ignore your questions and request for assistance. If she likes you, she will spend a lot of time assisting you. This is not conducive to a neutral learning environment. Other instructors are so nice! She really scares me."

As the clinical instructor, she is suppose to demonstrate to students and allow them to practice guiding/correcting them to the proper techniques whenever necessary, well she doesn\'t.
