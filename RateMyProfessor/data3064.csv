She only teaches about 1/3 of the time during the semester thank god. Her lectures are useless. Everything she says just enrages me. I swear when she said she was done with her lectures there was at least a hundred silent fist pumps."

Her experience and major in medieval literature has expanded everyone\'s knowledge of engineering. She is well qualified and is a joyous professor ."
