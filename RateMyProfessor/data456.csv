Both were easy but I actually learned a lot. He\'s also actually interested in what students think which is cool. PRS points make up most of the grade so attendance is a must though.

Music isn\'t t exactly my cup of tea until I was introduced to the fabulousness that is Matt Morin. He is laid back and very open. He is also a total laugh, watching him utilize the entire classroom as his teaching stage is incentive enough to go to class. If the easy A\'s aren\'t enough as it is."
