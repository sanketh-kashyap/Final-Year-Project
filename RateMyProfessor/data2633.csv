She taught the concepts really but you still have to self study if you want that A. Her redemption system helps so don\'t get discouraged if you do bad on the first midterm. Try and and have upward trend in grades. I got a C on the first midterm but showed improvement later on and got an A in the class.

Fellow classmates described her as a mom teaching you Chemistry. Lectures are dry power points, but she did make an effort to make the class interactive with some group work. She is very straightforward with what you need to know for exams (study guides) and is most helpful at office hours."

KNOW HOW TO DO THE HOMEWORK!!! And if you study the past midterms, you can easily get an A in the class. If you go to lecture, pay close attention to her slides.

You must put effort into the class to get the grade you want. Her lectures are hard to follow but going to her office hours are so helpful. She doesn\'t trick you or give you anything you\'ve never seen before in her lectures. Overall she\'s the best chemistry teach I have had.

If you do the readings, the online homework, the practice tests, and so forth, then you will succeed in that class. The tests are straightforward. There are no tricks. If you can\'t answer it then you haven\'t understood the homework or practice tests. This is why you should go to office hours to clarify what you don\'t know."

There is no way you can fail this class if you attend lectures, study notes, do recommended problems, practice tests and go to office hours when needed. She is also incredibly nice."

Tests were very straightforward, no tricks so long as you understand the material. She\'s very helpful and nice, and is open to suggestions. Curves are so-so if you really need them.

Overall i ended up with a b in her class. She has a curve but not as good as other teachers. An A- is 85% while other teachers set their curve at 80. Her PRACTICE midterms are a joke...

But because they are so tricky, there is a huge curve. Shes definitely not the best at teaching and needs help learning how to teach. Her accent is bad and needs getting use to.

I feel bad for her, because nobody listens to her and everyone treats her like **** .... yes her Chinese accent is irritating, but her class wasn\'t hard.

She\'s probably the hardest chem prof. If you do have her though just read the book and do problems in the book. If you don\'t understand the concept make sure you ask TA. If you do that, you\'ll do fine. I just read the book did problems in the book and got an A. Not THAT hard but hard considering the other chem profs were easier"
