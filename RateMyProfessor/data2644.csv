Vance  Wilson,Arizona State University,Business department, Tempe, AZ,0,4.0,N/A,2.0,,2,12/07/2009,CIS360,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Class material sucks and can be difficult if you\'re not a CIS major. Vance is cool tho - he\'s funny and super helpful.Tests/quizzes are open book. Key to success is to make friends and do your homework in the lab during the TA hours and you\'ll ace all the homework. Choose a good group for the final project and you\'ll do well. I def recommend him.

As far as the class difficulty goes...it\'s pretty easy. Pick a good group and you\'ll be fine.
