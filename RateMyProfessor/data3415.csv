Took her time dissecting and teaching a subject that comes hard to a lot of people. Willing to help and responds immediately when you email questions. Very laid back. I would definitely recommend taking her class. I would say easy A but I don\'t like math.

I took her for College Algebra as a summer II class. She also teaches high school so she is fine with slowing down and reworking problems until everyone is on the same page. East to talk to and willing to help. She even changed due dates to give us more time to understand the topic.

She lectured for about 15 minutes then it was on everyone else to figure it out. Im decent in math so I was ok but others had problems. I tried to get her in a lecture course for next sem but I waited too long.

However, her teaching skills are very poor. She doesn\'t lecture but just reads from the e-book. She has no structure what so ever.

I was familiar with the material so it was fairly easy for me. Teacher does not explain problems, and ask students what to do instead of her showing how to do it. I basicly tought myself using the homework. If you suck at math, dont take! But if u are familiar with it then go ahead!"

Rather than just going through the textbook or a slide show like many teachers do she works through problems with the class. She is very helpful, always willing to work with you."

I like many of you am horrible at math. She is very willing to help and takes a lot of the stress off with her relaxed attitude. I have seen some lower scores for her on here, I think if your not willing to try then you will fail, that isn\'t on her. I have had 304 and 350 with her."
