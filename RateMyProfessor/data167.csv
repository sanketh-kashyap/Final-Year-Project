VERY good instructor who knows what he is talking about. i am not good at science nor do i enjoy it, but he makes the class and topics interesting. i wish he taught more classes so i could take another class of his."

He\'s nice. DON\'T BE LATE. 1 paper-good and easy, several quizzes-pretty easy(from book), few tests-medium(straight from your notes, which you can use), he might do some take-home quizzes too. He may be slightly boring but he\'s a good guy."
