Guy essentially reads you the textbook, class is on a huge curve to start with and curve magnifies as quarter goes on because Excel isn\'t permitted on any exams (but is allowed for HW, figure that out). Very helpful if you have questions, cares about his students & wants them all to do well."

He is a little boring and drags on at times but he is very helpful. He is easy going and laid back. Great teacher to have in class.
