Ashby  Tyler,Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville,English department, Edwardsville, IL,0,3.0,N/A,2.0,,1,01/27/2009,ENG101,3.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Goes by ""Ashby"" and is a teaching assistant who teaches 101 and 102. Dresses unprofessionally and class is cancelled more than you will attend. Overuses his sense of humor and ability to relate to students because when it comes time to teach, no one can take him seriously. Grades fairly, but getting a paper back takes forever."
