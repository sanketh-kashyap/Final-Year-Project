Kenneth  Potts,Waubonsee Community College,Music department, Sugar Grove, IL,2,2.1,N/A,4.3,,4,09/21/2011,MUS101,1.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I found him a terrible, arrogant teacher. He didn\'t seem to care about his students at all. I went from loving all kinds of music to dreading going to his class. He was the only bad of 30 plus teachers I\'ve had at WCC. I did the readings and he picked obscure questions for pop quizzes that even if I read twice, I wouldn\'t remember."

Readings are not that bad, 10 pgs a week and a short essay on one of the readings. Exams can be difficult but if you pay attention in class and take notes all the questions are there and in the readings. Would take another with him"

He\'s disrespectful, rude, and extrememly boring. Class attendance is mandatory and he fully expects everyone to read all assignments in the textbook. Lots of useless busy work, tests are somewhat difficult. Overall a terrible class."
