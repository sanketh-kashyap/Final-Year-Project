He really cares about each student. He teaches MAGNIFICENTLY. I hate early morning classes, but even if I\'m sleepy I can still completely understand his lectures. He really takes the time to explain in detail that you as a student will understand. He knows we aren\'t mathematicians but students and he\'s just amazing. He\'s wholesome"

He gave us two practice tests and 2 pages of notes to bring into the final. He doesnt care that you memorize the material as long as you can apply your knowledge. I would take ANY math class from him and I wish he worked at UCSD full-time. I was so blessed to have him while he was here.
