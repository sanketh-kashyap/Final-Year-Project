Classes are pretty easy going and he provides breaks throughout. My class was 3 hours long but flew by. Blog posts every week along with two generally big assignments but they aren\'t that difficult. Would highly recommend.

Weekly blog post reflections about the readings, the projects are writing a lesson and unit plan. Otherwise the class is spent with hands on and engaging activities to show us how to teach. Very insightful and would certainly take again."

The man makes class boring and is pretty hard, considering it is an education class. I would recommend someone else."

He knows so much about the subject and makes class interesting, which is important since it is 3 hours long!

Although his expectations aren\'t realistic for beginning teachers, it does give us a goal to work toward. He used to teach in high schools and his other job is helping at-risk schools - he knows his stuff! Recommended highly!"
