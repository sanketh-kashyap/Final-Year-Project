Narrative evaluations on written work were very fair but hard to know what that equated to in terms of a letter grade. So you never knew where you stood until you got your final grade.She does, however, answer questions quickly and returns papers within 2 weeks."

She could have participated more, but was helpful when I asked for it. She is ""just okay"" and so is the class...though some of the material can be difficult."
