Anatole  Senkevitch,University of Michigan,Architecture department, Ann Arbor, MI,3,4.0,N/A,4.5,,2,03/05/2012,ARCH663,4.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Easily one of the best professors I\'ve ever had. A very demanding individual who expects the very best in his students, and is expert at coaxing it out of them. Definitely one of the most influential thinkers in my career, and a top expert in his field, particularly the history of Russian art and architecture."

He is completely oblivious to how a student learns. He shows off by using big language, talks to fast, goes off on so many side tangents that you cant get through all of the lectures, and uses discussion section to go over pointless readings when it should be used on his confusing lectures."
