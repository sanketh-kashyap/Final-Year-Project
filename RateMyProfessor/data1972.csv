A good chunk of people in my class seem to not like it or him which I don\'t understand because it is easy. You come in every week spend an hour learning about the history of Cinema and specific genres and then you get to watch a movie almost all of which are great movies. I guess it\'s just my generation that can\'t appreciate it.

Encouraged to think independently and be creative, growing beyond my comfort zone. Prof taught well beyond the basics and as a practitioner. Responsive to student interests and very supportive. Used handouts instead of text--very efficient. Learned more than I ever thought possible in one semester."

His lectures superbly blended photo/world history with personal stories. He was accessible, patient and proactive--seeking class input and communication re: issues. The class was demanding but fascinating. It proved very helpful in a later photo class--should go hand in glove with Photo 1."

Hes very helpful when it comes to editing your pictures to get that perfect print. The subject matter is also very interesting as well it makes you see photography in a different view. I enjoyed his lectures and the fact he taught the class how to use their cameras and how he challenged us.

If you are, you will find it very interesting. He teaches you how to see, which inevitably will make you a better photographer. He does not focus on the technical aspects of photography, but rather the artistic, and compositional."

He lectures a lot and it can be pretty boring if you\'re not an art major.Gives his first test after the first 8 weeks of class. Assignments are boring if, once again, you\'re not an art major.

Jaeger is a joke. He is a horrible teacher. He should be investigated by the college. No wonder why he is only an adjunct professor; the college won\'t even hire him. His photographs aren\'t that good either. Extremely hard tests. Boring! Avoid at all costs!

He only grades assignments on creativity, not content. He should stick to taking photos and not teaching. Very boring. Only likes ""art"" people. He makes you memorize tons of photographers and then gives you impossible tests on them. Basically impossible to get an A in this class. 2 tests. 3 assignments."
