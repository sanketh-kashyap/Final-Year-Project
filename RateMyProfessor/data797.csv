He is a genius and he is hilarious! He made statistics more enjoyable. Thanks Jerry! He does give a lot of homework but it is not hard. His tests are fairly easy. The book is used but not all that much. You could email him at anytime and he always answers.

Then because I didn\'t understand that portion it dropped my grade from an 94 to a 62. I hardly was able to catch back up to passing the class. Maybe in class he is better but not online. Definitely not online.

I took this course online and found the professor to be both very helpful and extremely prompt in replying to emails or discussion board posts. Frankly, I often wondered whether he ever slept because I could post a question at nearly midnight and still get a respone within 15 minutes."
