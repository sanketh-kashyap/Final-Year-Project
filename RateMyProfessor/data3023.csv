He is extremely helpful. He explained how relational databases worked very well and worked one-on-one with students if they needed it during the lab. I really liked that he used the CS Wiki effectively for the class; it\'s helpful and under-utilized by the faculty. Plus, he is a terminal badass and not a GUI pansy. Recommended!"

He always was more than happy to help. It also helps that I had a lot of knowlege of the subject before taking the class. I still learned from the class though.
