He starts every class with a joke. And if you happen to come late you\'d better expect to hear said joke. He is a fair grader and an understanding teacher. He does offer extra credit if you go to the writing lab.

You can NOT skip once, you will miss out on repetitive busywork which is counted towards your final grade. Although he is very smart and helpful, the class is just a very medicore style of work. Also, gives ALOT of essays, VERY writing intensive, and grades them rigidly."

He kept every class interesting, and I felt the class time is too short because I enjoyed his class. He is very helpful man. I learned a lot in his class, and I also know how to develop my literacy. His class is not too easy to go, but it is definitely the best professor to improve your English."

He loves his class and tries his best to make his students work hard. He also is a nice grader if you are willing to put the effort into the class. The only negative portion of the class was that there were too many works. Sometimes it was stressful but later I realized it helped.Take him if you can.

So helpful! So nice! and not bad to look at! He made english fun!

His high energy and corny jokes make class enjoyable. I am not a fan of English classes and I did like this class.

I would most definitely take another of his classes and would recommend him to anyone."
