Professor Tsosie is the most down to earth, caring, and talented individual I have met. She is passionate about her subject and her students. There is a lot of reading (welcome to law school) but the assignments are easy and the final is not bad. Participation counts so be prepared!"

She\'s very nice but also super leftist which may not be a problem for some but you have to write your exam knowing that.

She came to class every day with so much energy, and smiles, and always rooted us on. She is open minded and loves when people share their ideas. If you can, please take her class and get ready for a wonderful experience!"

Tries to keep you motivated and in high spirits. You have to attend class though and the reading is pretty extensive. There is a midterm paper of 12 pages you have a week to do it and the final is closed book.

She knows her stuff inside and out, and is willing to bend over backwards to make sure you get it. And yes, she\'s hot, but toothpick thin."

(Check ++ anyone?) Her mood swings almost had a student in tears during one class. Promotes sycophantism to the point where she had over half the class voting for a closed book exam at the end of the semester. She does know her stuff though, if you are willing to put up with all of that."
