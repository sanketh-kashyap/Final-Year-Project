Joann  Stein,Camden County College,History department, Blackwood, NJ,5,3.2,N/A,3.2,,15,03/02/2014,HIS10108,3.5,2.0,Mandatory,N/A,N/A,A,,0,0,"Despite all of the negative comments, she is pretty fair. There is about one essay quiz per week and three exams throughout the entire semester. You need the textbook to study for the tests and quizzes, she gives the EXACT question a week prior to the quiz/test. She\'s a fair grader and grades on quality not quantity. Her class is boring but easy :)"

She never goes over what she\'s done. It is lecture, and she has a problem repeating herself when you ask politely. I had to actually contact her after class and she was still cocky saying I need to study more and take ""less detailed notes"". I was fine with quizzes, but tests FORGET IT. Just read everything."

I do not think she understands that this is a 100 level course and that she could help students more. The class had 3 essays, and you do not know the topic beforehand. For a subject which requires much memorization and reading, it was a lot of tedious work."

The class takes real effort but as long as you\'re not a bum and actually try, you\'ll pass easily. People in my class somehow got Cs and Ds on easy quizzes, which are really easy As with some studying. I recommend her big time."

Make sure you just read and take a couple of key points before quizzes and you\'ll do fine. Lectures are interesting. Can get slightly boring, but overall, very good class. Very smart lady. Very inspiring and wants you to do well. Take this class!"

Please keep in mind that most people at Camden county are losers so theres no wonder she seems stressed at times. And i love her passion for History. A in my book.

I.E. come in 20 minutes late EVERYDAY, pop gum, etc. Her exams kinda suck because she doesnt tell you what to study, but quizzes she does but tells you like 2 days before the quiz."

Stein, however, is awful. She writes illegibly on the board, gives out random and oftentimes wrong information, and does not give out study guides for all essay exams. She says that each test is ""on everything"" and asks a question on a very minor subject."
