He knows about design but he is not the best to teach it. He lacks strategy and follow through. He lost our sketches a couple of times. Sometimes we were doing assignments unrelated to the class. Overall there was a lot of confusion with him

TOUGH GRADER,2,0,"Kevin\'s a very confusing professor on his best day, and on his worst, well, try not to waste your time showing up. His projects were easy and straightforward, but he always said ""something\'s missing"". Never bothered to remember our names and that was evident during critiques. He lets you hand in late work, so long as you say you\'re ""real sorry""."

When I asked for help I always felt that I was annoying him. When talking to him, he always looked elsewhere & interrupted me to speak to other students walking by. He was disrespectful, expected a lot out of his students but did not do much for his students. Nightmare."

Nice guy&very sincere. Wants students to succeed and will go out of his way to help and meet up with students to answer and help out with questions. HW: sketch, sketch and more sketching.. Class seems pretty easy until he started giving out grades. Ouch. DO YOUR BEST and follow the guidelines and you will be fine."

He is more disorganized than anyone I\'ve ever met. It\'s difficult for him to keep up with email and grading. Unfortunately he often requires students to email him their assignments that he ""forgets that he had received"". He is a time suck w/little reward. He\'s incredibly pretentious and thinks he\'s God"

He gets ticked off by tardies though. He assigns readings on oasis often, they are necessary to know for the midterm exam. Do your drawings and your ready to go."
