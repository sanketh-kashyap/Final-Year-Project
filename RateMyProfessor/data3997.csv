The tests are pretty hard, MAKE SURE to study prof grossmen\'s exams and you should be fine. She always says to come to her office but she\'s not very helpful. Although she\'s hard, she hates people failing..we got TONS of extra credit so make sure to do it."

Homework is assigned but not graded. So you don\'t have to do it. The exams are REALLY hard. But you can earn extra credit on the exam and extra credit in the class.
