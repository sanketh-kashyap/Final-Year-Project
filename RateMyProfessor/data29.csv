Some classes were interesting but he seemed tired and kind of checked out during class. Very easy A but didn\'t get a lot out of the class.

There are about five assignments, a few quickwrites (responses to movies watched in class), and a few journal entries. No tests and attendance is taken every class. He was incredibly knowledgeable and had lots of stories. He enjoys hearing about your experiences as well. Very nice guy! I recommend him!"

Attendance is mandatory and he treats the students like they are elementary school age, making us sign in after break. That being said, he is an extremely easy grader, almost everyone gets an A. Be prepared to spend 3 hours a week learning what NOT to do to inspire your students."

Most of the time we watched movies, and wrote responses. Easy A, speak up in class and you\'ll do fine."

He is an easy A. His class makes you think about what you want to gain from becoming a teacher and lets you know if you still want to teach, inspiring class. A little on the boring side for some lectures."

Dr. Padilla didn\'t require a text book. Be sure to set up your host classroom before school starts so you can get started right away. Very helpful, wants to see his students succeed. Highly recommended."
