She means well but does not explain the assignments to the point where the entire class is baffled. I\'d much rather have her for soc then dr. mead but they are both very very confusing!

She offers a lot of extra credit and has a tutor in the arc for help. The main thing in her class is journals. Not only does she allow you to correct them and get a better grade but the ones that u didnt do, she will give u a chance to do at the end of the semester as full credit."
