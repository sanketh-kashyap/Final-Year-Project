I took welding at Palomar during the summer session at night. Being a female I was a bit worried about how I would be treated/not taken seriously. My goal was to learn welding basics in order to expand my sculpting skills. Although I had to rethink my original plans, I came away with the ability to do basic welding."

Lectures are useful, gives notes outlined in power point. Quizzes are easy and open note/book final. Is always willing to help students and do one on one demos. Would definately take him again."
