Bridget  Clarke,University of Montana - Missoula,Philosophy department, Missoula, MT,4,4.1,N/A,3.4,,5,03/03/2013,PHIL999,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,2,2,"I can\'t say enough good things about the manner in which she teaches or the material she chooses to teach. She listens - yet has control over the class direction. She is approachable and very intelligent. As other users have said, and i will repeat, she is only one of two prof\'s that care about the students as much as she does her own research."

I took her seminar in ethics and it was fantastic. I\'ve noticed a lot of philosophy professors tend to shoot people down all the time but Prof. Clarke actually listens to what you say. Her assignments are reasonable and she\'s so helpful if you need help or clarification. She\'s seriously awesome.

The book is frustrating and useless, but her explanations made things MUCH more clear. She is enthusiastic and has a pleasant disposition and isn\'t afraid to help if you\'re willing to ask for it. No one who could have sought help but didn\'t deserves to badmouth her or her classes."
