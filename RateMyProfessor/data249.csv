You can find other postings on her at Akron bc she just moved to OSU. Do NOT take her unless forced! We don\'t talk about anything having to do with Soc. Theory, instead she goes on 2-hour rants about her own political and anti-religious beliefs. She makes you feel like an idiot if you ask a question."
