PARTICIPATION MATTERS  TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"Wow, this professor was a tough one. She gets very agitated if someone is late or gets up to use the restroom. Bathroom breaks shouldn\'t be an issue. It\'s a basic human need that no one has control over. Not only is it embarrassing but it is also more disruptive to the class to be taken issue with over it than it is to just silently get up."

There is a decent amount of work and she is strict on not having any electronic devices and she tends to be a tad on the crazy side. She thinks she is hilarious and that\'s funny in and of itself. There is a lot of work but it isn\'t hard and if you attend class you get extra points.

All lectures tend to be scattered. Unorganized- in one of the worst possible ways. I speak for my current class when I say DO NOT take her as a teacher! She\'s a great person, just not cut out for teaching. Her inability to teach makes the class hard"
