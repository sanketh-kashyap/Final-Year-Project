The first day of class he asks everyone\'s weaknesses and then tailors his classes around that. He is also very encouraging and very funny. He is the best English teacher I have ever had. Great guy."

And he\'s almost NEVER on topic. He seems cheerful and nice, but he can be so boring. I found myself constantly leaving around halfway through, unable to stand sitting there. The workload\'s easy though, leading to a satisfying grade."

Sometimes tends to ramble but he\'s more than willing to explain things to those who ask. Emails back quickly."

Class usually isn\'t on topic but is interesting. He is actually helpful when it comes to writing. He also takes advantage of blackboard with online postings and homework and clicker questions.

He\'s the best teacher I have gotten at Carroll. All of the written assignments are really easy and he gives out a lot of extra credit. It\'s extremely easy to get an A in the course.

Not to mention his personality is fantastic, makes English VERY funny!"
