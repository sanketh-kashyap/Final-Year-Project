He obviously knows his history, but can not teach it. I\'ve had interesting history classes, this is not one of them. If you actually want to learn and not have regurgitated information spit out at you for a couple hours, don\'t take this class."

His lectures are relentless and irrelevant and above all UNINTERESTING. I\'ve had history courses that kept me interested, this is NOT one of them. Essays are simple, tests are hard.

Keeps the lecture fun and has pretty easy assignments. Received a B in his class, and am happy with the grade. If you show up everyday, and participate, you will do fine. The tests are easy and you barely use the book. Just listen to his lectures and don\'t talk when he is talking and your fine."

There are 3 books required, The Narrative of Frederick Douglass, Give Me Liberty, and Interpretations of American History. You don\'t really use Give me Liberty but you use Interpretations for 4/5 essays. His classes are lectures and discussions. He likes it when people speak up and and ask questions."

He lectures the whole class period, and you rarely use your book. Although, there is a secondary book you are required to use to write papers on. Book is horrible :/... Overall the class isn\'t too hard, but attendance is mandatory."

He is a very boring teacher and talks in a mono tone like he bored. At first I thought he was blind and deaf because he look like it but he watches you every move. It is mandatory to go to every class or he starts bumping you down letter grades. If you like lecture i guess take him.
