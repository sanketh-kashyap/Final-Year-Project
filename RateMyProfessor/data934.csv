YOU WON\'T PASS.,1,1,She knows her stuff I\'ll give her that. But the way she curves the grades is with extra credit. Homework is extra credit as well as daily quizzes. She\'s pretty condescending and doesn\'t understand that students don\'t automatically understand concepts being taught. She has made remarks about students that made them feel dumb for asking questions.

I\'d much rather have a profess that doesn\'t grade as hard and no extra credit. Some student I knew did do well in her class. though these were the A students that do well most classes. If your a B/C student like me I\'d someone else.

She is always available by email to help you and she will get back to you almost immediately. She is also available to help before class.
