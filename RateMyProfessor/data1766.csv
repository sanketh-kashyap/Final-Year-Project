Timothy  Jensen,Lynn University,Business department, Boca Raton, FL,0,5.0,N/A,2.0,,1,01/31/2009,AVM120,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"He\'s a very interesting teacher, who in a sense is just like a student. Easygoing professor, laid back. Jensen is very prepared for everything so it\'s suggested that you\'re also prepared. He\'s really helpful, just ask. Textbooks, Visual Aids, and Practical work is expected, but it\'s fun in nature."
