However, he does give a lot of writing assignments, but you are in college get over it. Overall a great professor who knows his stuff."

He doesn\'t give enough time for responses, the plays are boring, the text sucked, & there\'s way too much writing. He gives huge vocab sheets and only uses ~5 of them on the exams. It\'s not an acting class, it\'s an English class! The only fun part was the workshops. I don\'t reccommend this class unless it\'s your major."
