She volunteered her time to tutor our class on difficult material. She shows a true passion for her students, nursing and her patients.

Her sarcasm gets annoying and gets in the way of a good lecture. Oh plus she treats you like 5 year olds. I\'ll never forget the day she came in and yelled at our entire class fo graduate students"
