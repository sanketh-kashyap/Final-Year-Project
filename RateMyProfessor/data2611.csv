OK, let me just drop out of my 3 other classes, lock myself away with a group of monks for the duration of the semester and memorize these bi-weekly 30-60 page readings by heart. I never wish upon *anyone* to lose their job but if I had to make a list of candidates, she\'d be very high on it."

She ruined my interest in Latin America. She\'s opinionated and a super hard grader. It\'s a level 1000 class and she grades like it a 4000 level. Failed the midterm despite crazy studying. Miraculously passed the final. I liked her as a person - go to office hours - but terrible prof.

That should tell you enough but the class had an 80% drop/withdrawal rate. We started with about 35 and at the end were about 7. It was a low-level class but she taught it like it was grad level. Even if you do ALL the readings you probably won\'t do well.

She expects you to know everything almost word for word from readings which aren\'t easy. One time she got so upset she ended the lecture early and told us to go back and read the whole thing over when we just didn\'t understand it. Definitely can\'t advise her and I doubt her other classes will be any good.

Requires students to do all the readings from the textbook, even IF it is not going to be covered in class. Gives stupid quizzes that everyone hated because it was over details on the readings, then she accuses the class of not reading even IF we have because the awful quiz scores. Yells at the class a lot."

At first she was really mean, but softened up as she got more comfortable. She can be funny when she is in a good mood, but scary when she is in a bad mood. You never know what you\'ll get. She makes you rewrite everything which is maybe good but also hard when you have other classes."

Too much material, readings are too hard, and when we don\'t understand she says we didn\'t read. Did she ever consider that her questions are bad and that is why we aren\'t answering? Don\'t waste your time and risk your GPA on this class."

I dread going to this class because it is awkward and everyone can\'t stand her. The class readings are hard, she covers way too much too fast, and she is really impatient. It would be ok if it was hard and she was nice, but it is a hard class with no payoff since she is so mean. Future students: Don\'t take her!"

Reading is expected and frankly is too much for the given time and is hardly comprehensible. She gets angry when you don\'t answer her questions, so unless you\'re extremely interested or good at history i\'d avoid this class."

You have to do the reading for this class and when people don\'t, she yells at the class a lot. Not very approachable and seems like she doesn\'t enjoy teaching at all. I don\'t recommend her to anyone who wants a teacher that gives a crap about their students."
