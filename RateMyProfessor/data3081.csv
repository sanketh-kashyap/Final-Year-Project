However, he does not prepare well for his classes and his lectures are reading the chapters to you in class from the online book. Some actual teaching does occur when he tells you his experiences, but not usually."

I took all 4 CCNA classes with him, and am now in CCNA Security. He\'s fantastic. He\'s very knowledgeable, and is willing to help with labs as long as you show you\'ve tried to do them yourself. Highly recommend for both newbies and tech veterans."

The first week was spent just talking about current events in the tech world. He focuses on information security, but not on a level we can\'t understand. You can tell he loves what he does. I hope I have many more classes with him."

Take this class if you just need to re certify - if your a newbie, you will be lost and most of the students at night are there for work. Not good for newbies."
