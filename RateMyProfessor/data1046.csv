TOUGH GRADER,0,0,"Hands down the most frustrating class i have attended. The classes and concepts were no that hard conceptually, but she needs to work on making it clear what students need to take from the lecture. It was almost impossible come test time to determine what she wanted you to say in a short answer. Would strongly recommend switching/swapping."

No, she\'s not going to give you an easy, high grade. But she will learn your name, offer help, encourage healthy discussion, and create fair assessments. Regardless of grades, Doralp creates a great learning experience for her students - the best I\'ve had yet!"

She adds humour and makes the lectures fun by adding videos and interesting trivia. Makes it interactive with questionnaires and personalizes the experience with name tags. Usually lets you out a little early and gives you a good break in her longer lectures. Great with questions"

Acts like a know-it-all but really knows squat. Once, she asked the class what we know about hemoglobin and a student said it\'s a basic building block for blood. She said, \'agh, didn\'t know\'. You didn\'t know?!?Hello Physiology 101... how are you a physiotherapist? Real talk, has no idea how to mark and should be fired. Also,THIRSTY!:S"

Immature, unorganized and it might have been nice if she had spent as much effort toward the production & posting of her power points as well as her teaching methods, as she did toward her appearance."
