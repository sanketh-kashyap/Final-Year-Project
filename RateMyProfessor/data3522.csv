She gets louder if she thinks you aren\'t paying attention and says she doesn\'t believe in study guides, but never knows what\'s on her OWN TESTS. Also, she will give you a side eye if you come into class even 5 minutes late. She told my friend that next time she should not come at all"

I came out very interested. Dr. Marritt not only made this class interesting but she did everything to help us understand concepts as non-science majors. I would not say this class or her tests were easy, but she was very helpful and extremely generous with her time. She gave lots of opportunities to learn."

She doesn\'t pronounce anything correctly. She is very confusing and hard to follow.

She tries to help you understand complicated processes with different examples and does so until the class gets it. The work was pretty straightforward you passed tests if you payed attention & studied.

Willing to help in any way she can. She wants her students to do well in her class. Great professor if you don\'t enjoy science, because she understands that some people don\'t love science."

She is so nice & is really concerned with how you are doing in the class. She teaches from the textbook & is straightforward. She is so helpful when you meet with her for office hours & will break down everything into baby steps to help you understand."
