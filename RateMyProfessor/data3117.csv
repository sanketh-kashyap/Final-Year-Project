Her lectures are boring and monotonous, so unless you are really interested in the material, it\'s hard to pay attention. She is a fair grader, though, and has clear expectations. But when tests come, and you haven\'t been paying attention, it can be hectic."

Tests were easy because she provides a study guide. Labs were not too hard either. I actually learned a lot and want to learn more in this field. Take her if you can!"
