I had him for my night class for HIS 108. Class was 6:30-9:30. We never stayed past 8:45. This class is all lecture which I personally enjoy. He has so much enthusiasm and charisma. You can tell he loves what he teaches. Be sure to participate to keep discussions going! Show what you know and you\'ll do great. Stay professor Kelly!

However, he jumps back and forth over the topics way too often. His exams are too specific and hard. Seemed impossible to get an A in the multiple choice. Part B of the exams are essays and you are able to prepare them ahead of time. His lectures can be very long and boring. Absolutely hated it."

The mult choices are part 1 of test & on the book. focus essay then on book. Get 1/2 the multiple choices correct and you still get a B. He helps after class, has no office hours and is not a Prof, but just Mr. Kelly."

You will learn in this class if you put in the work...this class is not for lazy people!!!!"

Before insulting a professor who DOES know what he is talking about and teaching at least get the name right. Pay attention in class, read the book, and maybe you will learn something. Otherwise don\'t waste his time by taking the class."

Whoever responded first clearly didn\'t try at all. If you do what he asks you will do well. He is extremely smart and interesting to listen to as he clearly loves what he is teaching. Anyone who disagrees is just bitter because they did not do well in his class. Pick up a book and learn how to read.

By reading the text book at home was the only way I could do any thing on his tests. He always asks for the littlest details on his tests and they are so hard. If taking this class good luck and make sure to read the text book thoroughly. Do all the essays before the test.
