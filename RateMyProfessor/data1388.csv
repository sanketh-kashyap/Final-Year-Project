I can tell she wants her students to learn and do well. She is a fair marker and gives useful practice problems. The only thing I didn\'t like about this course was the online quizzes because you don;t get points for showing your work. (But quizzes don\'t count for much anyway.) Her TAs are helpful too.

I was honestly terrified of this course at first but she makes it so easy with all the practice problems we have in class. Very accessible outside of class and cares about her students. Keeps the lectures entertaining by throwing in some jokes here and there. 10/10 would recommend. If only she could teach BIOC2001

She goes through her lectures very quickly but she posts all of the notes online the night before which is really helpful. In class TA\'s are helpful but if you have a question she\'s more than happy to answer it herself. She can be kind of scary and intimidating but wants to help.
