I took a hybrid and I would not I would just take this class online if I could. I would not take him again.

Took online and by far the easiest most insightful class I\'ve taken at LCC. I highly suggest taking this class with him. Would be a good online summer class"

I took his class in the summer and there was just waaaay too much homework, but in a full semester it wouldn\'t seem like so much."

He makes no sense sometimes but helps you so much. If you dont get something BAM! Ill help you with it next class then you can turn it in the week after! And I mean seriously everything. Ive gotten 4 extensions, out of like 6 assignments. If it werent for him being so laid back I probably would have failed my other classes."

Some stuff he goes over will make no sense at all but that doesnt take away from class experience. If youre interested in the stock markt, its an excellent class to take and Eric makes learning about the stock market interesting and easy."
