He tends to give very easy exams and a second chance to students who don\'t do well in the midterm/final. It seems he cares more to be seen as a cool teacher than if you have actually learned something or not...

Put my ECO 110 professor to shame... His accent isn\'t THAT bad compared to what other people have said (especially if you have listened to other UAlbany Econ professors. Got a guaranteed B, which later became a B+, on the final for answering a question in class. He want all his students to do very well. Big recommendation for him."

He is able to make a really tough and confusing topic very easy to comprehend. He is also very helpful if you see him for extra help. Class is also very interactive and extremely interesting. I learned a lot in this class because he makes international economics fun and i didn\'t think i would ever say that.

He seems cool, tries to keep people engaged, asks questions in return he will give you an automatic A or B on exams. But, the questions are of course super hard. His accent is hard to understand. HW is hard. He lectures right from the book so its a chore to go to class. So Boring."
