Kendall  Friedman,Rider University,English department, Lawrenceville, NJ,3,4.1,N/A,3.2,,5,10/11/2012,COM120,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Even though you can only have her if you are in RAP she is one of the best teachers at rider! I had her for expository writing and research writing and did well in both. She really likes you if you work hard and follow her directions, but if you\'re lazy and show no effort...good luck. Definitely take her if you want to be a good writer!"

She is not very accepting of Views that do not pertain to her own. Favors Girls in the class over guys. Can be passive aggressive and seem ""fake"" sometimes. I would not recommend taking her. Run and hide."

Gives very interesting topics to write essay on, and bends over backwards to help her students. Is very nice and I wish I could take her all four years. I would recommend to anyone"

She\'s helpful and sweet, and sincerely wants everybody to do well. She\'s the director of the student success center, so she only teaches students who go in through the RAP program, but if you do have her, you\'re very lucky. She\'s an awesome teacher!"
