There is a book, but I never got it since it is not used. The class is only 100 points. A paper, an in class question, mid-term and final. No other quizzes or assignments. Go to class and take good notes because this is what is on his tests."

I finally felt challenged at a college level. this is a class were you learn the material rather than remember the material just for the test.

Take his class on Saturday...He let\'s you go early as long as he gets through the lecture. The midterm is alright and the final is super easy since he tells you exactly what\'s on it. You don\'t really need the book if you take notes. No HW just the midterm and final.

He tells you exactly what will be on the test. You must show up to get the notes, and there are a lot of notes! He\'s hot so it makes him easy to listen to."
