Kimery  Levering,Binghamton University (SUNY),Psychology department, Binghamton, NY,1,3.0,N/A,4.0,,2,06/22/2011,PSYC243,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,She can\'t teach at all. Her style is too relaxed for an academic setting and her test questions are nothing like her examples during lecture.I expected someone with more experience. Shame on the psychology department for hiring her! STAY AWAY!

She even made SUMMER school enjoyable and interesting. I highly recommend taking her class if you ever get the special chance to do so. Read the text (which is real interesting) and listen to her awesome lectures, and you\'ll do fine in the course."
