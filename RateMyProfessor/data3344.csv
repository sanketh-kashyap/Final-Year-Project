He clearly does not know what he wants and will not be able to explain what he wants from you as a student. Kind of funny such a horrible professor is working in humanities.

I basicly did what I wanted on the assignment and still did pretty good because he uses the book and the book was confusing and more complex then it needed. He is slow getting your grades back to you. He grades rather hard.
