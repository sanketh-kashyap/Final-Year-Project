He gives several outlines. His exams are based entirely on those. Memorize it! Manditory attendence. Quizzes are ambiguous. Changes format of exams every time. You must complete reading or you will fail every assignment. He thinks he is an English Prof. Grades on grammar & spelling

Gives you TONS of USELESS reading and tells you to remember outlines that dont even appear on the exams! Lectures are EXTREMELY BORING and deducts points from grade after missing just 2 classes!
