He\'s really into sports and brings a great perspective. Hard subject, easy class but he grades a lot harder than most of the teachers here. You\'ll learn a lot if you put in a half decent effort. Hard compared to the rest of the school."

Hardly ever responds to emails. He frequently makes mistakes on quizzes, tells the students he will gives them the points, but never edits the grades. Has you do a 10 page paper with a 15 minute presentation with zero guidelines. Sure, he is a nice guy. Not very good at his job tho"

It is clear he knows what he is talking about. Sometimes he seems nervous teaching but overall he is very clear and as long as you show up to class you will do well. Expectations are pretty straightforward.
