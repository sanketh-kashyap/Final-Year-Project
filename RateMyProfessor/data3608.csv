She does everything short of filling out the scantron for you. If you are looking to actually learn the material instead of just regurgitating facts, however, take someone else. All she tells students is what will be on the test and nothing more. She is funny and very friendly."

She is an easy teacher, but you will not learn anything coz she is never prepared. If you want to get a proper career, I suggest you take another professor."
