Makes you to study hard and understand the details of the topic. Do not give straight forward answer of your question. Sometimes expects a lot from you. You have to study everyday if you are taking class with him to get good grade.

He is not an easy professor to get a good grade on your tests, but if you are willing to put in the amount of time that he puts into the class you will do fine and be a master at the subject. Given the opportunity I would love if he tough all the classes."

He uses way more time than given. What he presented in class is very different from the test. Overall, this guy is an incompetent professor!"
