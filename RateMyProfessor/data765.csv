What I instead got was an analysis on why all movies are anti men. Whether it be Woody Allen, The Coens, Tarantino, it\'s irrelevant, as, to quote her, ""Facts are a tool of the patriarchy"". If you want actual film history, look elsewhere."

Just be as anti-men, as possible in all your essays and articles. In addition, try to under analyze as much as possible and make as many poor assumptions as you can think of. Also, write as elementary as possible. The A is easy if you write like a fourth grader. I am being serious btw"

She\'s very knowledgeable about the subject of women as subject and creator in the art world. I was already interested in the subject, but she is the reason that the class was so worthwhile. If you get the chance to take any of her classes, do it!"

Well its NOT easy (8-12p research paper AHH) but it is a lot of fun and very interesting. She really seems to know what she\'s talking about, she\'s a good prof. I would recommend this class to anyone sincerely interested in the material, this is not an easy A"

Also have field trip journals and a research paper, both written and oral presentation. She is a nice teacher and she does grade fair - you get what you deserve. However, the downside is that she TALKS for the whole class and there are no breaks."

She is hard, and her courses are a lot of reading, but they are fair and she grades fair."

She makes you work for it in order to get a good grade. This class involved a heavy reading and writing load but has kept me on track and lead to me learning and retaining more information than many other classes. She cares about the material and though lectures can become a little dry, it is up to you to start discussion."
