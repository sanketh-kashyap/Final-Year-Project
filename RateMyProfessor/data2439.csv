All are called papers, but some are short answer types that are under a page. Very accessible. I texted, called her, and sent inbox messages to her on the World classroom portal. Gave good feedback when given. If not given, I asked and received it. I learned a lot as I had no business background."

Very understanding and worked to make sure we got the most out of the class. I\'d highly recommend this class. It was challenging, but overall rewarding."

Engaging and open-minded. During class we disagreed on economic concepts(She works for the US government concerning trade; I come from an Austrian-Economic background which views public governing entities less efficient that private firms) we did find common ground and accept my opinions. No book; got an A.

I think primarily because she shouldn\'t teach online classes. Assignment instructions were about as clear as MUD! Took forever to grade papers and respond to emails, which is KEY in online learning. I would not recommend this one AT ALL. I think classmates would concur."

She was extremely nice and helpful. She had an awesome sense of humor too. She expects you to come prepared for class: Read the cases, text, current news etc. Do your work and participate and you will do fine! There is a written case due every other week and a final test. She respects every student!"
