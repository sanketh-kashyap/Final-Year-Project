He\'s smart, he\'s passionate, he believes in social justice enough to put his money where his mouth is, not just words. You have to work if you disagree with him. Everyone would benefit from taking a course."

Atleast thats how it seemed to me. I felt like he only taught what he wanted the class to hear. I did not like his teaching methods."

He is more than willing to help anyone in the class. Lalor doesn\'t put down other majors, he actually incorporates them into his lectures so everyone can understand. If he were closed minded would he encourage students to write their own songs to perform during class?"
