Shes an YA book writer that loves history but when talking about it in class I rather be water boarded. She hate confrontation and no grades are up for discussion even if you think she\'s made a mistake. This is completely unfair to the students.

She is kind and very tough at the same time. In her class be sure to follow all guidelines as well as do ALL of the readings and take good notes! Tests are rather difficult!
