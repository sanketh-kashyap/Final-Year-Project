U have 2 hour lecture and then the rest is lab time and u can leave once ur done with lab the lab. Mike is very helpful and if u miss a class he will help u make the work up. Wish he teach other classes because I would LOVE to have him again. If u pay a attention in class its almost impossible to fail.
