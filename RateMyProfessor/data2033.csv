Usually this is bad, however he is an interesting lecturer, even if he wanders off topic occasionally. He really knows his subject matter. He is very likeable, and will do anything to help a student who really wants to pass. I recommend him and plan to take more classes with him."

First day of class he asked to meet with each student individually to find out more about them and their chosen CIST program and let them know he is available to help in anyway he can. He is highly respected not only by students, but also other CIST faculty."
