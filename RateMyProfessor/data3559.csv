She does not bore you with reading the classics, instead you read Confederacy of Dunces and Rule of the Bone. You write three essays and a Anaotated Bibliography. You can re-write any paper and the higher grade sticks."

She explains everything VERY well and will even edit your papers for you if you turn them into her early (take advantage of this). This class was easy- you just have to write papers that she will help you with greatly.
