Erik  Dranoff,Fairleigh Dickinson University - Metropolitan,Psychology department, Teaneck, NJ,2,4.0,N/A,2.0,,5,04/20/2012,PSYC1102,4.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,He uses the book as a guide but gives power points and shows videos a lot. He is very interesting and offers a unique perspective on the field. He is very approachable and will give the questions in advanced but he does not give questions that come from the book so class attendance while not mandatory is important. Overall I would take him again.

He gives no homework, and he tells you the questions that are going to be on the tests. The tests are essay (blue book) form and are only 3-4 essay questions. Just pay attention and you\'ll pass no problem!"

I had him for a night class that was 2 1/2 hours long and it was annoying because he would go on rants and talk only about specific things that he liked instead of all the material for the class. But its an easy A if you can tolerate the rest.."

Uses ppt and stresses good writing. Hard grader on paper, very critical and wants specifics. Tests are multiple choice so listen and you should be fine, however he never returns tests so you don\'t know what you got wrong. He encourages class discussion. Overall good teacher."
