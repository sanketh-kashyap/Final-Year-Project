I thinks she expects a little too much of the students.But overall she gets through to you and I think shes a good professor, I just get annoyed how shes late with grades for example today is the last day to submit final grades and hers still arent up!"

All she asks is to take notes on whatever she assigns you. She doesn\'t check it, but it helps when you have info to share with her and the class. There are no quizzes/tests, just two museum reports. She tells you exactly what she wants from you on those reports. BTW, Final is sort of hard!"

She\'s a great professor, clear about the subject and what she expects from the class. Her class is well structured, so don\'t miss any of the reading assigments. Professor Suchma is also very helpful; she\'s funny too. Her enthusiasm will keep you on your toes. Must take at JJay."
