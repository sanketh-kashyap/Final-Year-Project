You can actually learn a lot from this course. Basic self defense to training exercises. All students can benefit from time spent with Professor Park. Very relaxing class, starts with meditation and then stretching."

He has a strong accent so it\'s a little hard to understand but his class is fun. You don\'t need to be fit or muscular to pass, all you need to do is put 100% effort into this class and he\'ll notice."

Grandmaster Park is very motivated in teaching his students, and he has fun while doing it. He is difficult to understand, and at times he has difficulty understanding us, but if your patient, you\'ll get a lot out of his class. Attendance is mandatory, and he will give you a workout! But why else are you taking this class?"
