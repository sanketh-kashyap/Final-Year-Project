Extremely condescending and never had anything nice to say to anyone. He made it really hard to enjoy the class and although I love painting, I couldn\'t stand going. He was just rude and I would highly recommend avoiding him."

BEWARE- HARD GRADER. i was sure i was getting a definite A+, but at the end, i got an A-, im not one to complain about an A- but this one was unjustified; i feel like he wouldnt give an a+ unless youre picasso"

At first I was really confused , I wanted to give up majoring in fine arts completely , but one class he took a step back and really clarified things , which helped a lot and I improved greatly. I would recommend him as a teacher."

Does nothing to help with your artwork and only badmouths you instead of giving constructive criticism. I would say he plays favorites but he doesn\'t seem to like anyone in his classes. It was because of him that I personally lost interest in art and stopped being an art major."

He\'s sooo pretentous and is unable to encourage and support the work of his students. At the final he proceeded to insult everyones artwork, instead of acknowledging all the progress the class had obviously made. he\'s clearly disgruntled by his current situation as a professor,although maybe hes just a jerk!"
