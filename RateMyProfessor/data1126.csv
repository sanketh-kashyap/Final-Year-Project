I enjoyed watching his lectures as he paced about. Easy to listen to and understand. He\'s approachable and laid-back. His experience at (current) practice make for good, interesting stories and he\'s not particularly anal about anything. Don\'t bother with the textbook unless reading is your preferred way of learning."

Genuinely wants you to be ethical in practice and takes a practical approach to learning. Read the rules but no need to read the textbook. Has sincere concern for his students and their well being.
