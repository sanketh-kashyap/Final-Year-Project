Robert  Baker,Empire State College,Criminal Justice department, Saratoga Springs, NY,0,4.0,N/A,3.0,,1,02/08/2009,CHS2604,4.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Intro Criminal Justice Prof. Baker is a very fair grader. He does not participate in the discussions but DOES monitor them. He is medium level in his written papers but has a manageable amount of work. I recommend him as a teacher if you have to take multiple class loads.
