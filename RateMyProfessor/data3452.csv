He uses powerpoints but he cant keep his train of thought, he really relies on the powerpoint although I know he can give the information without it. Good demonstrations and very friendly. Attendance only matters when there is a lab that needs to be done."

Not comprehensive tests but tells you what is good to remember from the lectures so go to class or you have to really study everything. Tests are pretty easy, multiple choice, fill in the blank w word bank, label diagrams. Great teacher would definitely take again."

Some material was a bit complicated but he made it easier to understand. Labs were fairly simple. There was no study guide for any exams, but he gave good hints during lecture so I recommend attending class. Final exam was the trickiest but it\'s not impossible. Study the pp slides well & you\'ll do great."

He made a class that I was already very interested in so much better. He is hilarious and seemed to be very passionate about his work. He\'s very approachable and wrote me a great recommendation letter when I needed it. Pure awesomesauce.
