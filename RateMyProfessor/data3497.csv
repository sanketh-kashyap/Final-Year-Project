There are assignments due throughout the semester, but not difficult at all. There is no book required for this class. It is a fun class, but occasionally she lectures all class and it can be boring, however, i would recommend to anyone:)"

Dr. Jackson pushed our class out of our comfort zone, resulting in our class having lots of fun! She\'s also willing to explain questions. It\'s an easy class-very easy A. I have a 115% in her class."

I am in intro to music therapy right now and I love it. Had no interest in it from the beginning, but she makes it extremely fun. She is always there to help and doesn\'t take herself seriously. BEST PROF EVER. TAKE HER CLASS."

She was extremely patronizing. Taught us nothing about MT. Assigned us a 4-page paper on the American Disabilities Act, then assigned us the same paper with a 12-page minimum the next week. Horrible, frustrating, annoying. STAY AWAY!"
