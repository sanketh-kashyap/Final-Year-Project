If you can devote your life for the semester to her class then you\'ll be ok. Going too fast is an understatement. You better find a native Arab speaker or move to an Arab speaking country while taking her class. Seriously..."

She likes talking about her husband during class who\'s from pakistan.., She\'s super rude and has a funny English. She needs to improve her English I guess before using this language as a tool to teach Arabic."
