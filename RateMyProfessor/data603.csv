Finally went to her office hours and she really made an attempt to help me understand some of the material.

She lacks the undying need to help her students succeed. My only word of advice is to run...seriously! She\'s very difficult to understand, and honestly makes her students feel dumb for asking qustions."

She is probably very smart but just simply cannot relay the material to her students in a way they can understand or let alone comprehend. Her tests are hard and not anything like what she tells you will be on the test. Would not take her if you get easily frustrated because she is not very willing to help explain.

Practice for test is a lot easier than actual test. Somehow managed to get an A. She seems like a smart woman, but her inability to speak English well creates many problems."

So basically, if you\'re bad at math and you need teacher assistance she would not be the teacher to take."
