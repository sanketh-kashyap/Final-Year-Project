The lectures are once a week and you are required to observe at a school site for 45 hours. I did 4 hours a week and it was very simple. Mrs. Schlievert is a very easy going professor she had lectures that were conversational. We always got out early and I learned a lot. Overall easy A.

It is already required that every student complete 45 hours of observation hours a week so why am I stuck in your boring class for 3 hours a week as well. You will pass with flying colors if you take her but bring things to entertain yourself orou will be bored out of your mind.
