She has a website that has examples so it\'s not hard to do the assignments. The book is also helpful. However, at time she can be confusing, so simply ask her to explain again or talk to her alone.She does offer extra credit as well. She is a great teacher who cares for her students."

We\'re in college, not in elementary school. Her itinerary for the class was extremely confusing. The first day of class, we had at least 8 things to do for the next class. I want to be comfortable in speech class, not angry. I dropped the class"

She tells you what she wants in her class but she can be confusing sometimes because she talks fast and would jump from one topic to another. I think she\'s not intimidating at all. She tries hard to make her class fun but sometimes she would turn out corny. I like her though, she made me feel comfortable doing my speeches."
