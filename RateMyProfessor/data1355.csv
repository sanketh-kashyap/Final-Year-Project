She doesn\'t teach. It is basically reading the chapters and taking quizzes and then writing 5 essay questionsweek. Be careful what you say in your essay answers, if you are asked your opinion it better agree with her on the subject or you may get a snarky response. Be prepared for a lot of reading!"
