She loves history but it is hard to pay attention in class. Few films we watched in class. i\'m sure if you find history intriguing, you might enjoy the class. If not, do not take for elective credit. If no other resort, i will say that she is easy going. fairly easy grader on the papers."

Hard because she is very scatter brained and jumps from topic to topic with no real segueway. She read from a paper throughout the whole semester and didn\'t make the class interesting at all. I am a good student and had a very hard time following her lectures. If you do take her class, be sure to take really good notes."

If your reading this, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. Absolutly horrible class. She treats this 100 level class like a 400 level class. I can not believe she is a professor, she read the entire lecture from papers. Last time she made everyone take their phone and put them on the other side of the room. who duz that?"

Hands down the worse professor I have ever had. Do your self a favor, dont take this class. She never knows what shes talking about if you ask a question 70% of the time she doesn\'t know the answer. She jumps from topic to topic, making note taking impossible. She teaches by reading everything from a paper. Most"
