I hated him for most of the semester until I realized he really is the most GENUINE Professor at COC.What I thought I knew about Film has forever changed thanks to Mike. Great teacher,friend,person"

He can be an jerk at times and he can be relatively friendly at other moments. He takes film very seriously and if you are in his class you better be the same way. No nonsense with this teacher. He can definitely be intimidating especially when he\'s on your set for your shoot. Overall, he is great; you will learn a lot."

But helpful and bright he is, if you love film you should take his class. And deep down he really is a kind person."

He gives his students the benefit of the doubt that they are smart. He can be a bit cynical, but he knows what he is doing and can give great advice when you seek it out. I\'m sure he would never admit this, but he\'s really kind of nice."

His knowledge and passion of film is very inspiring. After taking his class I now look at film in a whole new perspective. Not only is his class great but his tests are easy which is a definite plus!
