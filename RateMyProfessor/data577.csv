Knows most anything you could want to know, and is pretty good at explaining. The class was pretty easy, but I still feel like I learned a lot. Would gladly take another class with Kevin!"

I had him for MSCI 111 and MSCI 112L, and I\'ll have him again for Marine Geo next semester! He is very willing to help, and he explains everything as clearly as he can. (His English is pretty easy to understand, people exaggerate.) I highly suggest him for classes and labs!"

He\'s young, enthusiastic, and definitely knows his stuff and enjoys teaching it. His english is the only thing that I could see someone nitpicking about, but it\'s definitely not as bad as some others I had (math dpt) Overall, a great teacher who I would certainly take another class with."
