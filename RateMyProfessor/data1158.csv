Also, no clarity in the directions. His directions will be like ""analyze the case data"" OKAY?! What do you want to see? There are many way to analyze data and you are extremely vague thus making it hard to write your stupid case write ups."

No structure whatsoever and in the end nothing was graded. Very little gained from taking this course.

Blackboard looked HORRIBLE and was confusing at times. Quizzes were multiple choice but obscure at best. Very little communication was given.

He is very knowledgable in the field and can give a lot of real life explanations. I would take him again, only in a class with a better topic though."

Also, the classes can be drawn out due to lack of material. No tests but multiple 7 page papers that can take a while. Assignment due every class. I thought he was nice guy though overall."

Lots of reading and case studies. Not a fan of him as a person (he can be very condescending and definitely plays favorites.
