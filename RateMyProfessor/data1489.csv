James  Vesco,University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg,Accounting department, Greensburg, PA,4,5.0,N/A,2.0,,3,09/30/2013,MGMT1840,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Vesco is an awesome professor. He teaches probably the most boring part of accounting(taxes) but he is a good professor, and keeps the students interactive. The attendance is not MANDATORY, but you have a quiz every week, if you don\'t go, you won\'t pass. Do the homework he assigns and be active in class. P.S.- the quiz questions end up on exams"

He is very helpful and understanding. He wants everyone to do well. If you study and go to class then you should be fine. I would definitely recommend Mr. Vesco.
