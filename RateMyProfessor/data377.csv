It gives a good overview on biomechanics. Professor Li is very helpful and explains the concepts well. Tests are pretty straightforward and fair, and the group projects are interesting. I definitely would recommend this class!"

However, as a lecturer he is pretty boring and goes over a lot of unnecessary proofs in class. As a professor, he is difficult to talk to and he doesn\'t care much about undergraduates. His office hours are completely useless.Never ask him to write a rec letter."
