Never gives grades back and is picky with his papers. Really boring class, and he\'s a nutjob. Stay FAR FAR AWAY!"

Sure, he can be boring, but that\'s just how English classes are. I would definitely take another class with him."

He tells you to read, and then the next day he reads the assignment to you and tells you what it means. There is no point and most people sleep during the class, if they show up at all."

After a couple weeks of taking attendance, he stopped and so did people coming to class. Going to class is completely useless, he just talks on forever and writes on the board. Only 4 papers and they are easy. If you want an easy A and can fight falling asleep for an hour then take him."

The class isnt very exciting and can get really boring. There are only 4 papers to write but some of them are kind of hard. He isnt that hard of a grader. Classes are easy. I would take him..

He is very boring! He doesn\'t prepare you for your tests or papers. The tests suck because he asks you history questions and not questions directly from the plays. I would not suggest you have him as your professor!

Most classes he just talks about the readings and writes on the board. The class gets pretty old after a while. However, it was a pretty easy A."
