She is very clear about her expectations and lays out how to pass her class and if you do those things, you will pass well. She is not at all a tough grader and only assigns 4 essays for the entire semester. It is discussion based and hw is key but you have a week to do it. Not an easy A but not too hard either."

I had her on tuesdays from 6:20-10:00pm. She NEVER kept us the entire time (which was great), and her class was the best class I had all semester. She expects you to be on time with the book in hand. You have 1 paper due every 2-3 weeks and she is very clear in her requirements. Read, share, and show up!"

She is not hard just insecure of herself. She has some personal issues I detected in her personality, however, those are her problems. As a professor she is fair and professional. She demands participation and work to be submitted which is normal.Intimidating looking only."
