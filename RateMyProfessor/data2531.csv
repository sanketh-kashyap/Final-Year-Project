Had him for both Corp. Finance and Property. Clear, concise, funny, and to the point. When people waste time on stupid topics, he steers the class back on point real quick. Expect to read your assignments, as you can get called on. Fair amount of reading. Know the material, and you\'ll do fine on the test."

He is clear, concise, intelligent, fun and engaging. It\'s an absolute pleasure going to his class and listening to his \r lectures. Clearly knows his stuff and clearly prepares for each class. Very concerned that students understand. \r Mumbles a bit,"

Material was dry but he tried to make it interesting, and he was honest about which subjects were actually important in life. Final wasn\'t the most challenging but wasn\'t a breeze either... and there was more than one fact pattern."

Myers was awesome. friendly, clear, and helpful. The final wasn\'t just on one topic you idiot. Perhaps that is why you felt you learned nothing. Myers is an asset to this school and I hope he stays. We need more friendly, smart, and young professors like him."
