Friday nights were so easy with her in class, we read the book, discuss it in class, write a paper on it...it was so laid back and it was just a relaxing class to take because of how organized she was, easy going, if you couldn\'t turn it in she would work with you to give you more time! Take her class! she is great!!!"
