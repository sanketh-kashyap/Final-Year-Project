I usually hate group projects but everyone in this class ended up getting really close with one another which was nice. Jody is very motherly and understanding. Her deadlines are more like suggestions as long as you get your work done. Extremely easy grader. I highly recommend taking her.

She asks students what their class expectations are and what they would like from her as a professor, her study guides are exactly what will be on tests, and she is very flexible with due dates. Since the class is mostly common knowledge you can participate in class without reading but the books will be needed forHW"

There was a lot of fieldwork stuff to do out of class but as long as you did it you got an A. She has flexible due dates for papers. Unlike many of the other professors I have had, she just wants you to learn and do well!! She makes class fun and keeps you engage. I wish she taught all of my classes!!"

She is kind of like your grandma, super flexible with due dates, just wants everyone to be happy doesn\'t want to give you too much work. All class you basically just discuss the reading or powerpoint. You can buy the books and bring them to class but I never did a single reading."
