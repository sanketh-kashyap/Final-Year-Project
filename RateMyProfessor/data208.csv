I\'m not even interested in geology, and he made it interesting. He provides copies of all his power point slides so you know exactly what is going to be on all of his tests... no suprises. Overall, outstanding!"

Makes a boring subject interesting. Uses power points for lecture and gives students a copy, so not a lot of note-taking required. Tests are much easier if you don\'t skip class! Dr. Morrow is very nice and very helpful. I would recommend his classes to anyone!"
