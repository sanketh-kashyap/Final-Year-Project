Caroline  Page,Bevill State Community College,Mathematics department, Hamilton, AL,1,4.1,N/A,2.2,,5,07/22/2010,MATH112,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Mrs. Page was an excellent teacher! I took multiple math classes with her. I wasnt very good in math but she helped me learn how to work the problems. She gives study guides that helped me so much on the tests. I would definitely recommend taking her class.
