He assigns 3 tests and optional final and 2 take home tests that\'s worth 18pts towards 2 of ur 3 tests. Test study guide has approx 14 questions where the test will have 43 questions. He tries to trick u on tests, doesn\'t go by the book at all! Very monotoned, don\'t expect an A. BYE BYE GPA!!"

I goes off on tangents about everything and then you are confused on what it is you were to learn. The test are nothing like the notes. He is very unclear and almost every person I have talked to in his class is failing.
