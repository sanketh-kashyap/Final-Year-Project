He had us watch movies that had to do with the religion we were studying at the time and took us on field trips to places of worship of the religions we were studying. Best class I\'ve ever taken, best teacher I\'ve ever had. Hands down."

He was a good teacher, who knew much about the subject. He was nice and taught in an understandable manner. He was, however a bit conventional and.... well, dull. His class was an hour and 20 minute class, though, and that may have contributed to the bore factor."
