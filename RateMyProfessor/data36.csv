He makes class interesting and funny. He wants you to learn, anatomy is not all that easy but he makes it as simple as possible. He\'s not tricky and tells you exactly what to study. No book! He deserves more credit."

Tells you everything thats going to be on the test. THings that you learn in his lab is actually very helpful in the lecture class which i took it with some other teacher. Was hesitant to take him becuase of his review here. But will take him next time if possible. Made an A. Moderate work"

I agree he has a strong accent but is humble and will repeat/write on board i fyou don\'t understand him. He is very nice and gives tons of extra credit. I got a C on the final which everyone else got A\'s & B\'s on but still got an A in the class bc I had A\'s on the exams(super easy) and tons of extra credit.

Heavy accent/speaks very fast (hard to understand/nearly impossible to take notes). Spend most classes doing busywork questions instead of labs. Preps you poorly for tests - will give items ""guaranteed"" to be on tests that aren\'t and things never mentioned/covered in class are. Personally, I would never take another of his classes."
