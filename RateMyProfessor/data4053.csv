The professor often went off on long tangents and did not explain directions clearly. Students had no idea what to do. I wasn\'t told how to do my assignments until week 6, so I received an F in that class when I had straight A\'s otherwise. A GPA ruiner, would not recommend"

Sadly the professor completely butchered the class. Her assignments were confusing and disorganized. When you ask for help all she ends up doing is bashing you as a student. She personally insulted me more than once. I would never suggest this teacher to anyone."

Not the toughest class, but definitely one of the least interesting."

Was also not the clearest on assignment expectations, and had a hard time relating to the class. Nice lady though, knew her stuff and was interested in open literary discourse.. very willing to help."

However, she\'s kinda kooky and doesn\'t make sense all of the time. Also, when she says she wants participation, she doesn\'t just mean attending class. She means raising your hand and sharing, despite it being a 300 person lecture class. Not fair and she doesn\'t know ppl."

However she\'s understanding, intelligent and very german. I would recommend her if you\'re looking for a moderately challenging course, different kind of course because we spent alot of time discussing and reading sweet stories."
