Don  Brechlin,Gateway Community College,Mathematics department, New Haven, CT,4,5.0,N/A,2.4,,8,01/29/2013,MATHALL,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,I have had Brechlin as a teacher in High School as well as in college. He is by far the BEST math professor I have ever had. I have had him for a math professor in various math subjects over the last 10 years and he made me turn into a math wiz (And i hate math). Because of him I have done so well in other math courses. THANK YOU!!!!

Will not move on from a lesson if every student in the class doesn\'t understand. He\'s always willing to help. Doing homework is mandatory and there\'s a lot of it. But it\'s very much worth it. He is also a wiseass with a good sense of humor so class is pretty fun too. Definitely a great math teacher!
