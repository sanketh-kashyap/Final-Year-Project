Then we had a bunch of things to complete at the end of the semester. Her tests were both online, which is helpful, because we could use the textbook. However, she told us that the final would be in person; then, 30 minutes before the final was to start, she told us she wouldn\'t be there."

For such a vital topic to a teacher\'s practice,she offers very little in the realm of best practices & knowledge that comes from experience!"
