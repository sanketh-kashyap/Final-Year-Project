EAsiest classes ever. Weak teacher but sweet as pie. She sits in the front of the classroom during keyboarding and works on the computer the entire class, so it\'s an esy A. I leave class and she doesn\'t know it. If you want an A in class take her. If you need to learn something avoid her. SPSCC is a joke!"

She\'s slow and repetative...she says the same thing over and over and over and over and over. I wanted to take Groshill (sp)or McGaffick--they come highly recommended. AVOID Grandma Ellen at all costs unless you are brand new to computers or Word. She would make a great elementary teacher but she is not a college professor material.

I could not show up to class at all and not miss a thing. She has difficulty hearing and seeing. Students have to YELL at her to get her attention.
