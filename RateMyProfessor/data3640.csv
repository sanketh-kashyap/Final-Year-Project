Panagiotis  Velissariou,The Ohio State University,Civil Engineering department, Columbus, OH,0,1.0,N/A,5.0,,1,02/08/2009,CE516,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,this guy is nearly impossible to understand and the material is difficult. he snapped and cussed our class out. he does not give the TA any material and asks us not to talk to her. i would reccommend avoiding this professor if possible.
