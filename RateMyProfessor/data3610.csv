Rebecca  Graham,Rutgers - State University of New Jersey,English department, Camden, NJ,2,5.0,N/A,5.0,,2,06/27/2011,ENG101,5.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Prof Graham is awesome. She was helpful and encouraging but expected a lot from her students in terms of getting the work right, or trying their best to give 100% effort with their work. She is a sharp professional, yet down to earth and fun to learn from. Plus, her English accent is so sexy and she is stunning."
