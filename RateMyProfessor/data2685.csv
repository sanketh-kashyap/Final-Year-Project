He seems to really care about his students and their success. The format for his class is easy to follow and keeps the workload manageable. Do the work, follow instructions, and ask for help and you will do well!"

I took both ESOL I and II online with Mr. Park and if you do the work on time you will get an A. The work load is spaced out so that it never becomes overwhelming and he is really good about explaining projects and reminding you when they are due.

The pace for this class is the best I have ever had for an online course. Spaces assignments and coursework out so that too much is not due all at once. Has a letter for each module detailing everything that is due and what date/time it is due. Offers a lot of extra credit on assignments that are well done.

Lots of work, but that is how ESOL 2 is designed. Very clear. Great information. Gives a weekly letter on-line to follow. I recommend this teacher. Get your work in on time. Don\'t need both books. Wait to you get to class to buy book. You will need the book."

I signed up for HIS class but his class got mixed into a graduate class, without being told in time. The professor of said class did all the teaching (see Linda Evans) who also sucked. Hopefully this will not happen to you."
