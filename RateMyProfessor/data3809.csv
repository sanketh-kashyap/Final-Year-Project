CARING,0,0,"She is a great prof and really wants each student to learn ASL. She is a little bit of a tough grader with your signing but thats because she wants you to learn. If you\'re willing to put the effort in and feel uncomfortable at times, you will learn so much in this class."

That gave me the opportunity to watch lectures multiple times. She\'s fully immersive in ASL from the start--and I\'m so glad because it forced me to learn and infer until I KNEW the information. The coursebook/DVDs that was with the class is necessary. I really enjoyed learning from her

I have never taken ASL before and was excited to learn, but that switched a few weeks into the semester. I didn\'t feel that I could ask questions without being made to feel dumb, and the feedback I received on assignments made me feel that way too. I wouldn\'t recommend."

This professor doesn\'t realize that not everyone is fluent in ASL and that they may struggle with it. Her feedback made me feel incompetent and that I was capable of being successful. If you want to learn ASL, DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HER."

After the third or forth week it got way to hard for me. She is a tough grader. Doesn\'t help explain a lot of what you have to do. I would not recommend her at all.

She will give do overs to some people and she won\'t give the same option to others. She is totally deaf and doesn\'t speak, so when you don\'t understand something you feel like and idiot. Very hard Intro class."

Each week outside of class you have to watch videos and do small assignments. You also have to make youtube videos of yourself signing which she then grades. I took the class as an elective, but its not an easy A. be prepared to put in many hours each week, but its doable"

She would go through things so fast and never explains the homework or what we did wrong. Over the semester I have dreaded more and more going to this class. She is deaf which makes it very difficult to ask questions.

The class is taught entirely in ASL, as Sherri is a member of the deaf community. This type of teaching made learning the language very interesting. At times, it was difficult to figure out what the class was supposed to do. However, after being exposed to the language, it\'s a breeze"

After this semester I feel that it was a waste of my time because I was not fully interested. The class is taught only in ASL, no talking is allowed!!"
