Jerry  Dudley,Central Virginia Community College,Communication department, Lynchburg, VA,0,5.0,N/A,1.0,,1,08/15/2009,BLD149,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Mr. Dudley is a Great guy. His carpentry class was excellent. I really learned a lot. He is very passionate about construction. His class is very ""hands on"". You get to build a small storage building in his class. Notice I said ""you"" get to build. He instructs while you use your hands, but he\'s never afraid to get in and help. Go Dudley!"
