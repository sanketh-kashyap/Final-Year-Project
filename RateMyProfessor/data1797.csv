She doesn\'t know the answers to her exams and she doesn\'t clearly state what you need to know. She doesn\'t read the book to teach. She also doesn\'t even know how to teach. How can someone be the head of the dept. if you don\'t know what your talking about. Don\'t take this at HCC."

Would NOT recommend this program.
