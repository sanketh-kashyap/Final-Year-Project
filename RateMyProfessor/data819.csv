Marc B.  Wilson,University of South Florida,Engineering department, Tampa, FL,1,2.0,N/A,3.2,,5,05/07/2010,EGN3000,2.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,He makes you write a 25 page proposal for a 1 credit class that is impossible to get an A on. His quizzes are dumb and pointless. Class is out of 100 points. project you will most likely get a 24/30 on so if you do not get every single quiz question correct you will not get an A in this useless class. BTW he doesnt follow the syllabus at all.

There are no trick questions. People complained that he doesn\'t teach. But that is not true! Just read the chapters before class, go to every lecture, and do all the homework. If your still having trouble see him during his office hours. Asking questions in class is too difficult."

If you ask him a question he doesn\'t know what he is talking about. But if you can teach your self and do all the homework problems the test\'s are exactly the same questions."
