There is a LOT of homework and outside work that is expected to be done. If you do the work and participate you\'ll get the grade you want! She is very nice and understanding, and is good as cracking a joke in class."

Some of the excuses I overheard students give her when it was time to turn something in were laughable, but Manolita was always understanding. If you care about your grade ALL you have to do is: show up, participate, do the homework."

She does give homework but it\'s not very hard. It helps your grade at the end of semester if you do you homework. She can be a little crazy but it makes class fun. She is very helpful.

But you get a lot of homework (everyday) but that\'s with every class. I\'ve heard she\'s the teacher you want if you\'re going to take spanish.
