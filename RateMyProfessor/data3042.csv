Claire  Thorson,Cabrillo College,Art department, Aptos, CA,7,4.0,N/A,3.0,,6,02/05/2016,ART3A,4.0,1.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,A,,0,1,"Figure drawing class had a very professional atmosphere thanks to Claire, she\'s very calm, kind, and organized. Classes are tiring and time-consuming, but worth it! Claire won\'t bend over backwards to help accommodate you, but that\'s normal. Not the most engaging teacher, but I didn\'t come for entertainment. Definitely worth checking out!"

It was difficult to get full credit on assignments. She wasn\'t great at helping me but everybody else seemed to get help from her all right. Attendance is mandatory, and you get points taken off assignments if you arrive to class late."

She, in my opinion, isn\'t boring at all, and is extremely open-minded to all types of art. Her classes were fun and engaging, and though the weekly projects took me a LONG time, I got some fabulous artwork out of it. I love her style of reviewing our work and overall commend this woman!"

I really enjoyed viewing every ones work and talking about our art. Attendence is mandatory but it didnt bother me because she rarely gave us homework.

She is excellent at pointing out what is wrong with your artwork, so you can improve your piece. Grade is based too heavily on not being late to class."
