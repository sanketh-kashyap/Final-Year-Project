She is a very hard grader. She whispers, so she is hard to understand in class. She doesn\'t understand that MSWord is NOT a graphic design program; it\'s for WORD processing (hints the name). The group project is ridiculous. This class took up too much of my time to only be a 3 hour credit."

Cannot miss more than 2 classes or you have to talk to her about not knocking your grade down. Projects involve more creative writing then technical writing. Try as hard as possible to not have her for technical writing. As a person she is very nice and fun to be around.

Assignments are laid out in advance, in detail, on the syllabus, so its easy to get ahead. Attendance is required, but if you have a legitimate reason, she will work with you. The final project is more difficult, but fun. Would recommend to anyone."

Also, she is either incredibly spacey or comes into class high half the time."

More concerned with attendance and having students regurgitate her own ideas than teaching. The material is easy but she\'s one of those teachers who refuses to give A\'s. Make sure you do all the reading aswell

Yeah she\'s disorganized but who cares? She IS interesting in class because she changes her tone, she IS a good teacher, and it\'s an easy A. I don\'t understand why anyone WOULDN\'T want to take her."

Her teaching style and disorganization are bad enough, but she has these phrases that she repeats when asking questions and it drives me nuts. She drags class on with her pointless stories and comments. If you ever have the chance to have her as a professor, don\'t take it."

Things seem to be either right or wrong with her and she tends to make things harder than they are. Just don\'t take this class or any class from her. Really. Don\'t.

Well organized class, and she was incredibly flexible and patient. Made literary analysis logical and accessible. You do have to put in the work to get the grade. Her grading system is rather ambiguous, but is fair in the long run over the many small assignments."

Dumb, makes everything harder than necessary, doesn\'t explain how she wants things done and grades on things that she never mentioned. Boring lady, you\'ll hear a lot about her life because she talks to much about it."

Assignments are simple but she makes them difficult. My blood boils during class because I can\'t stand her and her constant blabber to such an extent. I am unsure how she get a job.

She does not teach. It is painful to sit through class. I enjoyed reading before this class but now I doubt i\'ll ever pick up a a book again. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!
