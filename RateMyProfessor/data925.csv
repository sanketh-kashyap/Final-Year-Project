Her exams are very long and each problem is worth almost 10 points so unless you get it perfect she doesn\'t give you a lot of credit. She also isn\'t very good about helping you if you don\'t know something. She thinks you should just know as much as she does."

She really explains the material and helps learn it. She also offers help if you need extra. She provides good study guides and her exams aren\'t horrible. She is a great teacher and person and I would recommend her to all. She also tells really funny jokes haha.
