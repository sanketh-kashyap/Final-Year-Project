He has a pretty thick taiwaneese accent, which isnt made better by the fact that the things he writes on the board are disorganized and messy. Regardless: easy A."

He has a good sense of humor and is easy to talk to...he also drops the lowest out of the two exam scores and that is really helpful cuz the first test is easy!!! good teacher i would recommend him

If you want to get a bad grade take this fool.
