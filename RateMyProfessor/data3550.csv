He\'s engaging, hilarious, has a potty-mouth, and is incredibly knowledgeable. Always come to lecture ready to sing and to listen to songs from the 80\'s. PSA: Be prepared for difficult exams and not enough time to finish them."

Even though it\'s an 8am lecture, I never feel it a burden to get up early to attend his class. He pays attention to details and even makes a point of trying to learn each student\'s name. Really inspirational teacher!"

You have to put in the effort, but there\'s never a question of what you need to study or do for homework, so if you don\'t do well, it\'s on you. Lectures are interesting and funny, he plays music and sings and relates what we learn back to modern music."

Energy is infectious and teaches concepts in multiple ways without wasting class time. Often go to class just for the enjoyment of it. Always approachable and clear in explanations. Glad to have met such a fine teacher. Very easy class if you like to ask questions - people miss nuanced concepts.

His exams are only hard if you don\'t put in the necessary work.

He\'s clearly very intelligent and enthusiastic about his subject, and his lectures are always interesting and fun. If you go to class, do the assigned readings, and study for the exams, you should do well. He is clear and explicit about what is expected, and more than willing to help out during office hours."

His 75 min test should be for a 3 hour slot. His midterm and final included an exam and a paper! He gives homework on top of homework. For a doctoral ""review"" course this is a completely ridiculous amount or work."

I don\'t need to be shown how to pop a balloon to know about tonal language. I\'m not a fourth grader. I\'m in college, and would appreciate if my $40,000 a year wasn\'t going to buy balloons for his demonstrations. Figuratively."
