The quizzes and tests are insane, worded completely different than the homework or the way he himself taught it. He makes up the notes as he goes so you waste time watching him type, and he stumbles through the lectures. If you want to try and teach yourself economics go for it, otherwise, pass on him."

He actually teaches you the concepts of economics but his quizzes and tests suck. Just know how to do the processes that he teaches and you\'re golden. Also don\'t skip class because he goes over a lot of information. He constantly asks if anyone has questions and is willing to go over what he said. Grades on curve"

Failing quiz & test averages should drop a hint about his teaching. Gets upset if someone doesn\'t understand cuz thinks everything is obvious. Doesn\'t thoroughly walk thru examples so most of class ends up confused. Hard to study w/ no hw/textbook; we only get notes & used problems. I found multivariable calculus easier. Good Luck!

He grades 25% on Aplia,Discussion Boards,Midterm and Final.The midterm and final are 100 questions long. Be prepared to do many hours of homework even though it is online.I took it online because I hate sitting through lectures.I wouldn\'t take him again!!!"

He teaches straight from his notes and not from the book, which saves you $150 because you don\'t have to buy a book. No homework at all whatsoever, just practice worksheets he gives you for you to practice. Fun class for the most parts, he tries using examples we can relate to. Grades at a curve which really helps."

When u have a question, he will make u more confused. He grades students unclearly. U cant know where u are in his class. I thought I was doing well in class, midterm and final were ok, but then my GPA decreased really bad because of ECO class. Thanks to him >""<"
