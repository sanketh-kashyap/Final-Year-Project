Her grading might be little bit stricter than you might have expected, but you will be fine with pretty much everything as long as you follow her writing style. I ended up getting an A+ with such a great feed back at the end of last quarter. Not easy though, but will see how improved your writing is."

Lisa is funny and a nice person to be with.
