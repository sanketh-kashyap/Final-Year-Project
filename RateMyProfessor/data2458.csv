She\'s done great work and she\'s really nice to students. However, her teaching is all over the place and lacks structure. Also there is an insane amount of textbook reading that is very dry and not usually referenced in the lectures. Great person, but not organized."

She did not grade any of 12 assignments and arbitrarily gave us a final grade. Participation is 25% and she has the liberty to fill this in without accountability. This was the worst teachers I have ever had and our grad class felt the same.
