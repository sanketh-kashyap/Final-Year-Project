Do NOT take his online class. ANY for that matter. He is really late in responding to emails, is NOT clear on assignments, and will not upload them until the day before it is due!!! NEVER AGAIN!! If you want to be lost, then take this class. If you want a professor who is on top of things, take someone else."

Overall the midterms and finals were based off the lecture slides that he presented in class, to pass all you had to do were review them and you would be good on his test. Only two discussions each before the midterm and final, but overall id say he\'s a easy teacher"
