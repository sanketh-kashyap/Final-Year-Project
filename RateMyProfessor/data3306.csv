I took the Honors section of this class although I am not a COMM major, and although I was confused at first, she pretty much holds your hand through the whole class. Very hard to do poorly as long as you listen to feedback and ask questions. She will often give you answers to tests."

There is one major assignment broken into three parts throughout the semester with a final presentation. Listen to ALL of her feedback or you will fail. Follow the rubric to a tee. She accepts no excuses and no late work. Tests had study guides but required MUCH studying."

Her tests are HARD, too. When she says ""Understand"" something on a study guide, you need to study and READ everything about the particular thing she\'s talking about. She\'s not hard, but her standards are high though. She gives some extra credit. DONT skip class because her powerpoints dont explain everything on the test!!!"

One of the most knowledgeable professors I\'ve had. She\'s there for her students, but she does have expectations. The WKU COMM department is one of, if not, the best in the state."

This is my second class I\'ve had with her. There are five speeches, so you\'re usually starting your next outline when you finish a speech.
