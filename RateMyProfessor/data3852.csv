He doesnt do direct-instruction per se w/ outlines & a PPT. His classroom style takes on an open disc. style w/ him as a participant. Discs are stud-dir., & Prof W guides the disc. Most studs arent used to do this style & it bothers them. Grades arent assigned in the usu manner; he relies on part. in the disc."

During our class, he waited until the very end of the semester to hand back any grades, and he seemed to come to class unprepared to teach. It was as if he just showed up and started talking with no real thought about what he was going to say. He had all these plans, but never followed through."

Shows up late and leaves early, will grade you down if you don\'t agree with him, expects perfection, frequently changes dates and times and is incredibly inflexible. Condescending and disrespectful to almost everyone. There is NO learning going on in his classroom."

In the 24 years that I have been in and around education, he is the worst teacher I have ever encountered. His class is completely useless and his teaching style is terrible. His class is confusing and amazingly disorganized. He grades subjectively, has open book tests that have 10 questions, but cover 5-6 chapters at once! Avoid!!!"

You will learn nothing, take the hardest tests because you are not taught anything. Biggest waste of $ & time. I wish I never had this class with him. Believe me, You will regret it. It is not easy to get a good grade, but this class is crucial to further your career in education. Trust me, avoid him!"
