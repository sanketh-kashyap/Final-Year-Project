The second time I went. I was basically yelled at. I tried to solve the problem a different way which he wasn\'t able to understand. He then proceeded to raise his voice at me, ""Do you know what x is?!"". Afterward, I didn\'t want to attend class any longer and went to the other professor with my questions."

Although he can be extremely nice and helpful, his lectures are the book copied onto powerpoint. I do not doubt his knowledge of the material, but question whether he should be teaching a general physics course."

Ended up with A+ because of the extra credits."

You have to listen to him very carefully in order to follow what he\'s saying. That keeps you awake in class! Exams are not easy though."

His exam was very straightforward but the final was terrible. This was written with another prof though so that may explain the discrepancy in difficulty level."

Classes are easy to follow if you read the textbook prior to attending his class. A very good motivator and is always available to help his students. Extremely patient and wants all of his students to score well. His exams are reasonable (not difficult). Good prof!!!
