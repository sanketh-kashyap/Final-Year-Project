She\'s one of the best professors in the school. She cares deeply about her students. Very kind, very friendly, very adorable, very intelligent, very STRICT (she expects a lot from you), and very very helpful. She wants to see her students succeed and she will do whatever she can to help them do so. She\'s gold."

She has one way she wants things done, and if you don\'t do them her way she will grade you harshly. She is very strict in most things and will knock you down without thought. If you want lots of busy work and pointlessly vague and ""introspective"" work, then this is the class for you."

Easy-to-understand instructions/exercises. She expects a lot from you, as she should (e.g., ""I\'m not good at using Photoshop"" is no excuse for turning in crap). She is more than willing to help you with anything you\'re confused about or having issues with."

I learned more about myself in her class than I\'ve ever even thought about before. She starts you in a direction and let\'s you make your own decisions and discover your own things. She\'s more of a guide than a teacher, but she\'s definitely my favorite professor because she helped me understand myself"

However her goals for projects and assignments arnt super clear because she cares about the emotion and meaning behind a piece rather than its appearance.
