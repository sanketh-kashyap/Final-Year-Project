Pam  Stone,McHenry County College,Mathematics department, Crystal Lake, IL,1,4.4,N/A,1.8,,5,12/22/2010,MAT161,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"She was really helpful. Class would end early and she would gladly stay after to help anyone who had questions. All work is done from notes and homework given out from her. She gives a sheet with extra problems out of the book, besides that it\'s useless. Tests are straight forward and quizzes are all multiple choice!"

Final was a breeze, but it is one the school has written. She is pretty easy going and will go over any problem again just to make sure you know it."

Almost acts like a mom and doesn\'t take things too seriously. Homework, example, problems, discuss the chapter, and go home. Fairly simple. Quizzes and tests reflected the homework and was a breeze."

I\'ve heard that she not the most helpful but has easy tests and lets you leave early. If she is teaching MAT095 this summer, I plan to request her. I will follow up after I have her in class to let you know more information."
