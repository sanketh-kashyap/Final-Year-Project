Just shows off all the time and has no knowledge inside his head. There is a saying ""Empty Vessels Sound More"" He perfectly fits into this category. He knows nothing basically but he thinks he\'s the smartest professor in the whole world. And he overacts. Somebody should ask him how he did on the Stats3A final!"
