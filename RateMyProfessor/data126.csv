I have felt uncomfortable sharing opinions in class because I know she will belittle me or say I\'m wrong. Her assignments are unclear, she took off points for not stapling ""correctly."" Not a fan."

She is very fun and easy going."

She is accommodating to her students. Clear and open for discussion. Yes she talks about the Somali Bantu a lot but that is a special field for her and it applies to what she is teaching. Can go of on tangents and isn\'t very computer savvy. One of the most honest and fair teachers I ever had.

She knows her stuff but is not very sensitive to students\' level of engagement. Lectures can be very boring as she just talks on.
