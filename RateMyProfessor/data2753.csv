Ausch does come off a bit intimidating but really she\'s a softy. As long as you do your work, you\'ll be fine. Almost everyone in the class got an A on their observation. She comes from a different backround than most prof. being that shes a psych. But this is college so no whining!"

She is very unclear of what she wants from you and basically leaves you to stress trying to figure it out. She does not follow the grading breakdown given in her syllabus and makes grades up her own way. She also refuses to email you back explaining your grade. STAY AWAY!

She gives plenty of fair warning however with regards to assignments & pays close attention to attendance."

She was so unclear and did not want to help me at all with my paper topic. I asked her once to approve my lesson plan for field work and she totally did not give me feedback. When I taught the lesson, she was not even paying attention. I cannot believe she is a professor at Hunter College."

Email problems seem to be more of a technology issue for her than her unwilling to help - she is the ONLY quest teacher who can do a darn good lecture, stands up 200% for her students, and treats you like you have a brain. You\'ll need a brain to get an A, but if you have one, you\'re just fine."

I emailed her a couple of times for my project and she never responded to my emails. I needed help for my field work lesson plan and she did not care to reply my emails. Her assignments are a bit pointless because it is straight from the text book. oh if you did not attend class, u can get A\'s"

She did not want to help any of her students. She refused to meet up for office hours. She was also very rude to some of my classmates and graded alot of us unfairly... AVOID!!!
