He posted all of the slides online so we could print them up and he was always helpful when you needed any help. I didn\'t like the fact that it tooks weeks to get exams back and I never saw a quiz come back at all."

He is very passionate about history, but is just impossible to please. This class was definitely a challenge."

History is a pretty boring subject in my opinion but he has a love for the subject and tries to make it interesting. He has study guides for his tests and you only have to write one paper. I liked him a lot."
