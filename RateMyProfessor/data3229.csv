She expects us to work and most people don\'t want to. I came back to school at age 39 and she helped me ease my way back in to math. Her class helped me to prepare for college because most of my classes since then have been much easier. VERY sympathetic person and very personable. I cried when I left!

She can not teach,very rude,sarcastic and not caring about her students Why is she still there? I\'ve only been in college for two quarters and I only pray not to get another teacher like her. I had to drop the course, couldn\'t understand a word she was saying, and she didn\'t like answering quest"

She is uncaring, not clear on her directions, she can\'t teach. I had to go to outside internet sources to try to understand what she was talking about and to teach myself since she was so bad at it and made no sense. She should not be a college teacher I failed, mostly due to her!"
