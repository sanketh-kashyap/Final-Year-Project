She expects you to learn everything from these powpoint formatted notes she gives you, but the notes are so confusing. Her lectures are basically reading off her notes. Those 100 question tests every Friday were a pain. Im all about learning and having challenges, but she was none of that."

She comes to class right at the minute it starts. It is wise to take notes with a laptop and not hand write (she has a lot of notes that are only shared during class and in powerpoint format). She almost guarantees A\'s on LAB days and tests are every friday. She also offers extra credit.

She is late for class every day. Her lectures don\'t follow the text and the tests don\'t follow her lectures.

The notes can be tedious, but a test every week means they are only over one chapter at a time instead of 3 or more. She is not a dynamic instructor, but knowledgeable and personable. She offers easy extra credit in anatomy, but you will have to study for the exams. I would definitely take more classes from her."

Test are weekly. If you pay attention to notes, videos and lab work you will pass her class. She does give an easy extra which does help with your grade. Personally, I enjoyed her class."

I have her MWF and test is every friday. We takes notes all week and when it comes to the test it is nothing compare to the notes. Worst teacher ever to take for human anatomy because she forces you to get a 100 precent on the oral test in order to even leave the class first.

She always gives you test on Thursday and you are always taking notes in class. If you expect to get out early their is no chance. Test were ok but they are somewhat like the notes you take.

Tuesdays were for taking notes. Her notes can be confusing unless you ask questions. Thursdays were for labs (which are easy) and for the test. Study the chapter in the book and your notes and you will pass. She also gives you a chance for 100 extra credit points.

First of, she never really breaks down anything, she just gives you a bunch of useless notes 2 days before the test. When you get the test all the stuff you studied ISN\'T EVEN ON THERE."
