Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department, Tacoma, WA,6,3.3,N/A,2.2,Tough Grader (1)  EXTRA CREDIT (1),6,06/20/2015,PHYS110,2.5,3.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,N/A,TOUGH GRADER  EXTRA CREDIT,0,1,Was told that he was a great prof and I honestly can\'t stand him. He contradicts himself. His lectures are long and they drag out and the way he talks to women is degrading. Be prepared to feel like you are in middle school again. Thanks for ruining a subject that I am actually interested in..

Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department, Tacoma, WA,6,3.3,N/A,2.2,Tough Grader (1)  EXTRA CREDIT (1),6,02/03/2012,PHYS110,4.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,A nice professor to talk to outside of class and has a lot of information. He is willing to tell a story or two if you have time and probably into math or science. He teaches well and his tests are not like his reviews. Be careful when it is for the final because he shoved what was left of the final into one session.

If you actually want to learn anything, don\'t take this class. Horrible Professor. Extremely uneducated. Very unclear about expectations and don\'t ask for help because he\'s useless. By far the worst teacher I\'ve had since middle school."

The class feels like a middle school science course instead of a college one. I was disappointed with the simplicity of everything and wish i could actually learn something that i didn\'t know.

His dramatic ""events"" at the end and beginning of the semester make for a unique memory. As for the class, Astronomy is a good GUR to get out of the way. He has reasonable expectations (except maybe being OCD about grammar) and all you have to do is turn is assignments and take quizzes. Funny guy."
