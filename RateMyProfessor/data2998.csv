Ok. I believe this is the same ""doctor"" Decker I had; not at OSU, but at Baldwin Wallace University. Wouldn\'t recommend her, at all. She doesn\'t even seem to know that much about theatre. She thinks she does though. Acts as if she\'s the greatest teacher around even when the musical theatre students know more about theatre than she doe does....."

I initially took it just for the GE credit, but I\'m so glad I did. It definitely changed the way I see many things. She is a wonderful professor. She is fantastically clear, humorous, well-prepared, and very approachable. She is also a generous grader- as long as you read and listen, you\'ll get a good grade. Would recommend!!!"

She is very organized and leads great conversations. You just need to read the books before class to participate. You will also have some writing to do but it is always interesting topics and the plays are very interesting. I advise all students to take this class.

The lectures are very helpful, and the quizzes are from the lectures and book."

There is a fair amount of reading, but really small plays that you can usually get via library and there are lots of class discussion to understand course concepts. She is really help and great with questions. As long as you communicate with her, she is willing to be flexible, when necessary."

She did an excellent job reviewing for the first midterm. She required a lot of books but some of them you could sparknotes or even just read the wikipedia entry and still do fine with. There are two major writing assignments outside of exams/midterms.
