His quizzes are IMPOSSIBLE. My number one problem is that he won\'t say what will be on the tests! For the midterm: ""I may include questions from the last quizzes, I might add new ones..."" Not cool. I studying blind. :("

He literally read us the book in class. His assignments were vague but graded very hard. He has a nice personality but not the best professor.

Gets off topic but which professor doesn\'t. Willing to help. You just have to want it. By far one of the most intelligent man I have ever met.

When I had him in the early 90s, he class was related to Geography, Money, and Society. His class was engaging, interesting, and relevant. He is a hedonist, but very intelligent."

He is extremely off topic throughout the entire class, and when he is on topic he\'s hard to follow. You can study all you want but you\'re never sure what you\'re supposed to be studying so it doesn\'t help. Attendance isn\'t mandatory though, and I failed every test and somehow got a B. Good luck!"

He sounds like he\'s the representative of our planet talking to other galaxies when he\'s lecturing. He\'s so smart. He will talk about trips to Vegas and make it about geography.

I went to every class, and attendance was optional. The test was nothing about the notes or textbook. He curves the grade, but it was a stressful.

He actually told us that he wished he could bring a keg into the classroom and have girls dance on the tables, but that since that wasn\'t appropriate in our space, he couldn\'t.

He is very boring and unclear. Talks alot about sex and his ex wives. Try to get your hands on some exams from previous semesters because he uses a lot of the same questions.

Do the little assingmnts they add up to 20% of your grade. notes seem to be useless. read the chapter as he jumps around through it. Most questions on test come from random stuff that youve never seen before
