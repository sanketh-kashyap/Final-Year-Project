It\'s a no brainer take it with Chitwood. Got to write a fair amount of cool poems and imporved a ton at writing poetry was helpful during office hours in critiquing my poems. Only thing I will say that was annoying is that he grades participation subjectively but just speak a ton and you\'ll be fine. Great class and great guy.

He is more than willing to help you however much you need to edit your work, and he pays attention to how you progress during the semester. I really enjoyed this course."

His scope of understanding and creativity was limited, and the class itself was structured very inefficiently. We barely got to workshop, and many people didn\'t get comments back before having to turn in the next assignment. For a good class, take Shapiro or Seay, but not Chitwood"
