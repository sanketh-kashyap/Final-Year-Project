If you listen to her, you will pass the test. She tells you what you need to know. If you don\'t pass, you didn\'t put the time and effort in. She is tough, but she is fair. If there is something you feel you should have got credit for, talk to her and explain. She may just give you the points. Be prepared to work."

Her lectures and power points were ok but hard to follow. Her test were pretty difficult. They didn\'t treat the entire group fairly as in having study sessions and not inviting the other clinical groups. I was pretty upset about that. I did not have her for clinicals so no judgement there.

I came to this class almost expecting to be unsuccessful bc her reputation precedes her. By far she is the BEST. My only regret is I didn\'t have her in clinical.
