She pretty much goes directly off her slides, but you will need to read the book for reinforcement if you want an A. 5 quizzes and extra credit research. Highly recommend."

It blows my mind that people would rate her lower because she didn\'t provide slides at the beginning of the year. We attend a university people...step up your game! Class expectations are extremely clear. Five tests and some research extra credit. Quite helpful. Definitely recommended.
