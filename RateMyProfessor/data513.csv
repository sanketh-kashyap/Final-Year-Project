She is very helpful and if you go to class you receive extra credit! The test were basically the study guides!

She acts like coming to teach is the worst thing ever. The TAs are fairly helpful. DO NOT buy the books as they are not tested on, not referenced in class, and a general waste of money."

But she and her TA\'s are very helpful with the assignments when asked. My major concern is that there is no general textbook for the class to learn things off of for the assignments, so we must rely completely on in class lectures and appointments with her and the TA\'s if your confused"

And i sit in the 3rd row of class. The class is pretty confusing and she doesnt really help clear things up. It\'s almost as if she doesnt want to be there as much as i don\'t
