He has a constant excited energy in the way he teaches. Yes the comments about the music are true, however that is the least important aspect of his class. His motto for writing is ""depth not breath""."

He\'s outgoing and really helpful and wants you to pass. Though grading is a little weird, he will go over your papers with you to make sure you\'re on the right track."

It didn\'t bother me, and I found his extreme energy level engaging. As long as you show up to class, you\'ll do fine."

He\'s really big on correct MLA format and he doesn\'t normally grade on grammar. We did a segment on writing about film, which was cool. Lots of writing and proofreading. As long as you write your papers based on his guidelines and show up for class, you\'ll do fine! Recommended."

He played techno the whole time and read word for word from his power point. He had a weird nervousness that put me off and was all over the place.

This prof plays techno DURING class. He asked us to do our first in-class writing assignment WHILE he reviewed the syllabus AND played music. Between that and how incredibly bouncy he is my nerves couldn\'t handle it.

His classes always push for creative work or otherwise aim to expand ones own ability in English. I would definitely recommend him.
