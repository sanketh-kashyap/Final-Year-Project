She\'s the easiest English teacher possible. She\'s a nice person and funny. She goes off on terrible rants about nothing, but you can\'t help but love her."

Hands down the best teacher I\'ve had for english. Very helpful and very inspiring. Plus worst comes to worst I guess if you had no interest in the class atleast she\'s beautiful so it\'s not like it would be painful to attend her class.

She is also a little ditzy but other than than that she is a good teacher, and its an easy english class for the most part."
