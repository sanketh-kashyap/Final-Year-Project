ONLY take this class if you really sucked at those classes. Honestly, Richard doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about when it comes to this stuff. Plus, the class is an elective. Don\'t waste your time."

This class takes you through the basics of IPhoto, TextEdit, etc. Class project, creating a video from photos was interesting and fun. Highly recommend him as instructor. He is interesting and engaging."

I learned a lot- the lectures are great. He has you do hands on and is always helpful. The only instructor I have liked so far in Media Dept."

Cons: Used too much valuable class time which was limited already to discussion about the history of Apple Corp and Steve Jobs vision, didn\'t follow class schedule well. Overall would desire more structured teaching on course subject matter and less on Apple products."

Digital Photography is VERY entry level-- expect to learn little if you\'ve had any experience. However, he\'ll work with you to try to keep you interested in the class, and it\'s a great excuse to take pictures for credit :)"

He\'s pretty obsessed with the Mac and will try to upsell you to Mac products but he also knows where the good deals are. After his first lecture you will never want to buy a machine without a UNIX core ever again.

You get to work on a computer while he shows you how to do things using Photo Shop and other programs. Very cool class and good teacher. Learned a lot.
