He makes students feel stupid for asking questions that he apparently feels have an obvious answer. The structure of the class is insane. Rapidly jot down everything he says & prepare to answer specific questions about it later. You will not retain any of the info after its over because all you did was cram for constant tests and quizzes.

It was waaay too much and then we had a quiz right after lectures which gave us no time to learn and retain the material. There is so much material squeezed into such a short period of time. DON\'T TAKE THIS CLASS unless you want a low grade or fail!
