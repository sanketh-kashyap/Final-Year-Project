Probably one of the most helpful profs ever. Even helped me with a 391 assignment. Surprisingly learned a lot of him. Very intelligent AND a nice guy.

He wants you to understand the theories more than the calculations, therefore the tests were fairly easy. His slides do a good job of explaining, but had too many mistakes. Very nice during office hours and really wants everyone to pass his course (e.g. he adjusted a quiz mark because the class average was 74)"
