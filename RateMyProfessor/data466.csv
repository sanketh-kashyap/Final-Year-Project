I really enjoyed taking her class and was able to see how these things would benefit me in future classes.

Honestly didn\'t care about the projects we did in class (mostly art, gender/race issues), but that was personal. She\'s quite intelligent in the subjects, and always easy to approach. The only problem I had was the grading. I had an A+ on all 4 essay\'s, but left the class with a B. I\'m over it, though."

She\'s there to make you think. If you\'re open-minded, you won\'t leave her class the same as when you started. Can\'t wait to take her for Comp 2."

Very little is taught in regards to the actual subject. If you can put up with being subjected to her on sided views everyday you can get a good grade. I do not suggest her as a teacher.
