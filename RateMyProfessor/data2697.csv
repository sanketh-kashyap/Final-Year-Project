Participate in his discussions and be sure to not miss lectures. He is very intelligent, but expects you to figure out the answers. He invites you to get help from him , but does not give you clear answers. He is a very nice person, so if you show him that you are serious about the class, it\'ll be fine."

He encourages you to ask questions, but if you ask too many, he assumes you\'re stupid. If you like structure or instructions for assignments, do NOT take one of his classes as he offers neither. He\'s nice (or pretends to be), but I HIGHLY suggest avoiding his classes. Not worth it!!!"
