She is a washed up hack who could not make it in Los Angeles. She likes to tell stories like she actually made in Hollywood, but I have been out here five years since graduating, and every time I see a fake Hollywood egomaniac with no talent, I think of the class I took with her. Pass"

She jokes around a lot and made the class tons of fun. And she knows the material well from past experiences. I recommend this class for anyone with any interest in films and/or scripts.

Granted she is a stickler for being on time and not using your cell phone and she does tend to talk about herself a lot, but I really liked this class. I don\'t think she\'s that bad. She does tend to grade tough though. But the class was fun."

SHe will mark you absent if you are even one second late! She is mean and talks down to her students, she must have been picked on in high school because she now takes it out on us. She wasnt even the prof! Good luck"

Terrible in all aspects. For the love of your sanity, pass on her or else you may become suicidal if left in a room with her for extended periods of time!"

Her grading is so hard it is impossible to get above a C and her lame personality makes her all the harder to stand. If I knew I would be stuck with her, I would have passed on the class."

She has a massive ego and constantly talks about her time working in LA, but if she was even remotely decent in the film industry she would still be there. She\'s arrogant, egotisitical, and a bad teacher. She has NO CLUE what she is talking about. She needs to be fired"
