A little dry lectures but is an incredibly better option than the other option for teachers."

In class I just read and take notes on the textbook because I can\'t follow what he is talking about, he is that boring. I don\'t understand why the school doesn\'t fire this guy. Yes he is an easy A but I would rather have at least a small challenge than him."

It\'s as if his goal is to see how many students he can bore to death during class. His board markings, projector slides and repetitive oratories make you calculate daily how much money in tuition you are wasting. Yes, he is easy, but this is somehow never comforting"

Notes optional he really just quotes the book so on days when I was totally checked out I would just read and know everything I needed to know. He tells you exactly what you need to know for every quiz and test."

That being said, he is still a pretty good professor and wants students to understand the material.

I would recommend taking him for sure."
