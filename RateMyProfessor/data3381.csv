She is very truthful about life, finding a job, etc. Her class was very therapeutic and fun. I would definitely take another class if she taught it. I learned how to mix paints there, which helped me improve on painting. I can\'t say enough about her!"

If I did that to any painting, drawing, 2d, and/or 3d instructors (for example), sloppy artwork, I would be getting a D or an F. But in her class, if my project looks sloppy, then it is a C. My good attendance ends up averaging to B."

In Mrs. Sinclaire\'s 2d class, if the projects were sloppy and submitted and needs improvment, then it is a C. This means there is no way students can get a D or F unless they did not do their project."

She gets jealous of her students, and does not grade works by efforts that were put in, but only by how good they look. If you are a beginner in art, she will treat you very very nice, but if not, avoid her."

However if you are already at a higher level don\'t bother taking the class. she\'s very nice, and she makes the class a very relaxed atmosphere.

Critics are a bit fake...somehow everyone\'s artwork is amazing. Class is very structured, have to follow the rules on projects. Her tardy grades play a big part in your grade. Field trips are fun. Average 2D design class-Love it or hate it."
