I learned so much in his class, and stuff that I can apply to the real world. Even though his tests were hard, he gave bonus quizzes to help your grade. I didn\'t get As on every test, but ended with an A in the class because of that. I would HIGHLY recommend taking Dr. J for organic during your college career."

He is very willing to help outside of class; held review sessions before tests on his own time which were helpful. Organic is just a hard class all around, but he made it a little more bearable. The extra credit was also very helpful. Tests are pretty long and difficult but doable."

Dr. Janusz knows a lot about organic chemistry and you will get out of the class what you put into it. Would absolutley recommend to someone who genuinely wants to learn organic chemistry."

Very clear when presenting the material and followed right along with the book which made it easier to review. Routinely asked the class if we understood the material and made adjustments based on our response. Tests were long but he never threw any curveballs; material on the tests was fair.

His lectures are completely based on the book but puts them into terms you can understand. His tests are fair (especially if you do the study guide) just extremely long. He is always willing to help with any questions you have and tries his best to accomodate his students needs. You will learn a lot in his class for sure

Loves to help you and will do anything to make sure you understand the material. Very smart man. Tests were somewhat challenging but very fair. You can really learn a lot from his class if you just put in the time and effort. I would recommend him above any other O. Chem professor. I hope to have him again in the future.
