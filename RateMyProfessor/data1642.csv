He explains Psychology so profoundly through examples that we can relate to. He makes you think. Doesn\'t use textbook but doesn\'t have to. He\'s available before and after class. Makes you become a better you! You have to participate though and ask questions to understand yourself. Man! He could be the next Jordan Peterson!

He can seem rude and opinionated but he has a very unusual way to deliver his message/lecture. As a psych professor he teaches you how to think and use psychology to develop profiles. Expect to read a fair amount because his quizzes are based on the book chapter.

I do not understand how anyone could give a negative review. Students need to apply what they learn. The class is not intended to be simple .... its psychology !! Think outside of the box.
