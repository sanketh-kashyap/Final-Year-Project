Can get boring but pls don\'t take out your phone or laptop bc although he won\'t say anything directly to you, he makes comments about how no one pays attention and it\'s rude. You start to feel bad bc you want to pay attention but it\'s hard to sometimes. Easy listening quizzes and gives review sheets for tests"

I felt bad for him a lot of times b/c many people didn\'t pay attention. You don\'t have to take notes during class but I\'d suggest at least looking at him to show interest. The listening quizzes are easy but u really have to study for the 3 tests. He gives a study guide. No midterm or final. Take him! :)

He will comment on that every so often. Gives few exams but gives a review sheet right before them so you know exactly what\'s on it. Listening quizzes to identify instruments also. Very easy class and so relaxed. Take for sure

The class really is easy, show up, take notes and you are sure to pass. Listening tests are not at all hard,written tests are true and false and knowing to spell peoples names. Can become boring but is also really interesting. I recommend taking this class for a great grade and to learn about jazz."

If you aren\'t a music major, or don\'t really care about jazz history, this class will be boring. Only bright points about this class was no outside work, easy listening quizzes, and he\'s a pretty chill guy."
