He is an all around great human being that genuinely cares about his students. Explains everything very well. Must stay focused in his class and go and see him if anything is confusing. Extremely personable. If there was an option to take him again I wouldn\'t give it a second thought

Dr. Paul gives the practice problem sets before the tests and review questions during the recitation for the quiz. No questions outside of those questions are on the tests or quizzes. However, there are a lot of quizzes and tests. He is also a very nice guy who cares a lot about his students."

He\'s a good teacher who is always ready to help his students, but the class average on tests was consistently a C: that goes to show how hard his exams are. He does not believe in curves either. Hopefully he learns to ease up for the sake of future general chemistry students."

He\'s really nice and ready to help you all the time. The grading is just based off of the quizzes but they\'re not too hard. They do force you to stay on top of your material and not just forget it after every quiz but they\'re very fair and I\'ve learned a lot.
