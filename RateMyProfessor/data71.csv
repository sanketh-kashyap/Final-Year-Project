Use a 2nd computer and google those questions for answers. Browser is not locked down and your tutor can be the world wide web. He\'s not helpful and lacks any real teaching skill. He lets mcgraw test you and teach you. Only online class Ive taken where a teacher can have near zero skillset.

Online format really isn\'t that bad but the CONNECT system has so many issues. I read back 2 homework questions and petitioned for credit. Professor Alvayey did not respond. Went to office hours as one of the midterm questions was incorrect. He did a web search in front of me and explained it CONTRARY to the book. Avoid. Barely passed.

It\'s probably the hardest class I\'ve ever taken because I had to teach everything to myself and I didn\'t understand anything. The only reason I managed to pass was because he lets you retake tests w/ the same exact questions. He\'s a moron.
