If he is, his online class doesn\'t show it. The syllabus is not very accurate either. Find a buddy and take the quizzes together and do the big assignment at the end together as well."

Sometimes the business college just lets go of the good ones; their bad luck.

It is a shame that he is being let go after this semester. He made marketing enjoyable and I didn\'t dread going to class every Monday and Wednesday. His exams are tough but offers a lot of extra credit and side-assignments.

His quizzes are too hard. He asks questions that aren\'t really relevant to the subject. He doesn\'t keep his grades up to date so you have no idea how you\'re doing in the class, then all of a sudden your final grade shows up. He grades hard also."

He covers all the material for his tests and tells you what will be on the test. As long as you are therre to take the notes and spend a few hours on every study guide you will do fine. He is always available.

He is great about responding to emails, and his tests are very straight forward. Just study your notes and power points and you will do just fine! Oh, and he is verry funny!"
