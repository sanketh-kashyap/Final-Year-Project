Attendance is a huge portion of your grade and DO NOT be late. Class is really easy, bring a laptop. She gives great life/career/job advice. Class consists of a few assignments (easy) 3 tests, 1 paper. Never used the textbook."

YOU WON\'T PASS.  PARTICIPATION MATTERS  CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA,0,0,She\'s nice... but she has way too much energy for an 8 30 am class. She expects you to be there right on 8 30 and if you\'re a min late she closes the attendance and marks you as late. She\'s super strict on attendance. She\'s a bit too intense for me since i\'m a mellow person. if you have high energy in the morning take her. super preppy.

Quizzes/ exams are all on Canvas but you have to be on time for class. A knowledgeable AND personable professor is hard to find at MSU so definitely take her if you have the chance. She reassured my decision to major in MGMT!

I purposely choose an 8am class just so I could take her again. Students who dislike her typically don\'t enjoy participating in class. She will force you add something to the class. Don\'t just expect to sit there. She is gives tons of real life advice. She makes every class fun and lively.
