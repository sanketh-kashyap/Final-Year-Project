However as long as you put some effort in, you\'re likely to get full credit on your assignments, and his lectures are always interesting. Good class"

RESPECTED  CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA,3,0,"Dr. Stacy maybe a man with white hair.. but he knows what he is doing. He will grade you fairly. There are usually 3 exams in all the classes he teaches. He provides a study guide. Use it and memorize it. He is not a big believer of ""trick questions"". He also loves great presentations, there are always presentations for his class."

All his classes are the same and to attend his class is like torture! You take his class you will learn nothing and waste valuable time and money! He needs to retire and get out of teaching because he is way past his prime. UNO would be a much better school with some new blood and new ideas.
