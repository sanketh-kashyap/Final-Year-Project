Relations. If you enjoy raunchy humor and spending most of the class listening to stories, I highly suggest taking him for A. Gov. Maybe avoid Int. Rel., though. It\'s not his strong suit and the research paper had vague instructions and grading criteria. POL1510 though, is a 100% TAKE IT."

I only gave him a 1 for textbook use because he gave us a book we could use on the test that I didn\'t even need to open. He\'s a conservative but is still very respectful. Id 100% recommend him to anyone taking POL classes at OCC!!!

He seems like a caring person. I like him as a person but as someone that has become involved with politics, I disagree with 50% of his teaching and he\'s very strong in his views to the point it\'s not easy to express your views and concerns when it comes to our government polices."
