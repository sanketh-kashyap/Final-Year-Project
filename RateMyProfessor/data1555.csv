You can\'t count on her syllabus. She\'ll say one thing then change it. She\'s unclear and will take ages to respond e-mail. As far as actual work-load, its fairly easy. But this class definitely frustrated me various times."

She teaches you so much about special Ed and has a heart of gold. You will learn so much not only from the book and videos, but also from many of her real-life anecdotes that are a result of her many years of experience in this field. Take her class. :)"
