She helped me fully understand the subject. She offered extra credit at the end of every class which made us learn everything. You should definitely go with her.

Reasonable amounts of homework, quizzes and tests are what you expect, nothing too difficult."

She explains concepts in a clear and concise manner, she\'s friendly, fair, and makes herself very available for tutoring. I plan on taking her for the entire Calculus series."

Will put into you what you put into the class. Always has a kind word. Requires you to be attentive, and grades very fairly. Made Calc 2 fun!"

She is super nice and the best thing about her class is that she posts her notes online so if you miss class you can check her notes. Best professor to take the class with. Highly Recommended."

She doesnt teach or know how to use the calculator either. She\'s a grad student who doesnt have the time to be a good teacher. And she\'s not that hot.

She is extremely willing to help her students outside of class if necessary. I would not hesitate to take a class from her again."

Uses a variety of approaches to teach the material. Encourages collaboration. Extremely helpful outside of class. And she\'s only a Grad Student? She\'s a better prof than some profs! Her only flaw might be that people are expecting the same old style math class and experience cognitive dissonance."

Her tests are unorthodox as far as math tests go, grading more on conceptual comprehension than on being able to \'plug and chug\' the numbers. Homework is due every week."

Very loose teaching style, but not sloppy in any way. She is really excited about teaching and is easily understood. I really like her because she is HUMAN, she accepts that people have lives outside the classroom and easily works with your schedule. She understands and accommodates students\' different learning needs."
