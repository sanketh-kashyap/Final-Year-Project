Her class is not hard at all if you put forth any effort at all. She offers so much extra credit that even if you fail every test you should still get a A on it. She is nice and understanding but she know that you have to work for the grade you want. She is awesome!!!

She makes Botany fun and I look forward to coming to her class. I did have to study to get my B. Even if science isn\'t your thing, Mrs. E can get you through it successfully. I think she\'s the Best Professor Clarendon has."
