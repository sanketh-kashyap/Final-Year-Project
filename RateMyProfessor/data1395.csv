I always had a hard time with math in the past but she really made everything easier! All of the homework is online which helps when I have a question about a problem, she can usually help through e-mail or in the next class! She\'s such a great teacher that I\'m taking my next level math class from her too!"

Those of you who have a problem with the pace should take a class that meets more often. My work schedule caused me to register for her class. I learned a lot and thought the pace was fine. She is very nice and willing to help as much as she can.

I took the night class. I think this is the only time she teaches. Every nigt she taught two or three sections. If you take her, you have got to stay on top of the online homework and take good notes. If you struggle in math, take the class during the day because the night classes go REALLY fast.."
