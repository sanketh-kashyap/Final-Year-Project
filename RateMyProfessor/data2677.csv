She is very challenging, but you will not regret taking her class, if you truly want to be more fluent in the language. Profesora, if you read this, I will miss you so much! Gracias para todo :)"

She is clear and is always around for extended assistance. She does not mess around in class, gets right to the point. She knows how to make Spanish understandable and Professor Amicone raised me up in becoming more fluent in the language."
