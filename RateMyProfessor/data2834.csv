Sometimes he forgets to say the \'obvious\' things that complete the concepts he is trying to teach, but if you ask him, he will explain it very well. He tests on random things, so study everything, and he likes mechanism questions."

He also offers summer jobs doing research with him if you have high grades 85 or higher. But he has a very high expectation on what you should know for the midterms and final. To the point where he will ask questions on any biochemistry topic.
