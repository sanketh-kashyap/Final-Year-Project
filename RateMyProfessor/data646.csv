She basically gives you 60% free for just attending class and do homework. The rest is yours! People don\'t do good in the class mostly because they don\'t take the class seriously. Remember, DO HOMEWORK!"

Her quizzes are easy and straight forward enough if she give you enough time to do them. You need to go to her class about 15 minutes early in order to actually finish the quiz. That sucks for people that have consecutive classes. Talk about fair and equal competition.
