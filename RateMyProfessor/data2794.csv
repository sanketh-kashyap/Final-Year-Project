I would not really recommend this class unless you like hearing her talk about herself and teaching yourself everything you need to know."

All you need to do is study for the test and take notes. You definitely need the book. There were a couple of time consuming assignments, but she gives so many chances for extra credit that there is no reason you can\'t get an A."

Mandatory attendance and if you have more than one unexcused absence she drops your grade one letter for every unexcused absence there after. She acts like her class is the only one you are taking and overloads you with pointless projects. This is the only class I have ever made a D in.
