She lectures the entire class and then you go home and do the assignments. You have to pay for an access code in order to do the homework. The tests are taken in the testing center and are 20 questions. You can use a scientific calculator. I\'m not good at math and I struggled heavily. She recommends testing center.

Took her class in the evening so by the time we got to her class her attitude was about ready to go home.
