Exams are on very broad topics and its hard to decipher what she is looking for w/ each question. Grading is inconsistent and she doesn\'t explain why points are deducted. Don\'t expect to have a rational conversation if you have a question. Never deemed it necessary to write a review until now. GPA killer but shouldn\'t be.

Don\'t take her if you want an A. Her notes are useless you have to read the book to understand what she writes because her notes are very unclear. And on top of everything else she gives you attitude.
