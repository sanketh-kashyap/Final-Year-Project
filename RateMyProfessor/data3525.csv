YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,She dumbs down the material so it\'s easy for everyone to understand. She\'s very willing to help you. She tries to make it as interesting as she can and goes at a good pace. She gives homework but it isn\'t mandatory. I would suggest you do it though. She\'ll ask if there\'s any questions on homework at the beginning of class. I highly recommend her!

Math is my weak area and I have understood everything so far. Doesn\'t overload you with material or work. Take her class!"
