His syllabus does not say of what we\'ll expect to learn in the semester; 52 card deck lectures were confusing!! gives pop quizzes, & rarely gives HW. Lectures don\'t make sense at times, his notes are scattered & useless. MyMathLab was a waste of time & money since he only assigned 5 HW\'s up until i dropped passed mid-term"

He does not have a detailed syllabus on when a HW will be assigned; gives pop quizzes.

It\'s like the students aren\'t even present. Goes over problems that he says himself won\'t be on the test, makes no sense. I wish I would have known about him before I took this class, I would have not done so."
