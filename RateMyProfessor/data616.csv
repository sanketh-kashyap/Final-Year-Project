He was confusing in his explanations. To top it all off, he was 50 minutes late to the final!!! Totally unprofessional."

Answers on quizzes will be different answers on exams. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! He\'s HORRIBLE!!! When asked to clarify things, he just sends back nasty emails. Worst class I\'ve ever taken."

He is often confused with what he is teaching and makes rules up as he goes and then when tested on it the answer he said is wrong!And the study guides would be useful if he gave you the right answers. Good luck studying wrong answers!

You have to pay attention and the class matter is extremely hard. He keeps the attention of the class and keeps us motivated to keep going. I take his class at TRI-C Eastern & would take another class with him. He will ding you on spelling, but just catch him with a spelling error and it\'s a wash. Give him a chance."

He does not instruct, can not answer questions, or solve problems correctly. He tests and quizes on subject matter never presented and does not follow his syllabus at all. He makes things up as he goes. He is incompetant and unprofessional. Do not take a class with him it is a waste of money and time"
