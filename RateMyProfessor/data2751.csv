She was very responsive,assignments were clear, graded promptly and graded fairly. There were formulas to remember, but that would be the case for any finance class, had nothing to do with this professor."

Argumentative and unclear about what she requires. She would ask for one thing and then a few assignments later change her mind. She grades promptly and fairly which is nice, but I would avoid taking her courses."

Completely unreasonable and will mark you wrong for arbitrary reasons at a whim. Avoid at all costs.
