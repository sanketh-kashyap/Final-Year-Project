When you submit a paper, by the time you finish your outline, its not even your paper. Long story short if its not how she would word it or say it, you get an F. She is not an English teacher you would want to take."

She also has you turn in ridiculous sentence error exercises as though you were in 7th grade. If you do not format your papers, outlines, thesis statements, or ANY assignment EXACTLY how she prefers, your grade will be obliterated. Ridiculous amounts of homework for this class."

Makes the assignments harder than necessary. Not enough class discussion. She is not clear, helpful or polite. Worthless to take this class. Should have chose another instructor.

Makes you submit papers to a site to ensure they are not plagerized before submitting them to her. Will hardly respond to your emails and when she does it isn\'t helpful at all. If you don\'t follow her format for your essays you can count on getting a horrible grade. Try to avoid this professor if you can. Run, run away fast."

If you don\'t follow the format she lays out exactly, you\'re grade is screwed. Taking her 8 week online class, and I\'m regretting it. She makes you do grammar and sentence correction assignments, which I haven\'t had to do since middle school. Don\'t really care for her at all."
