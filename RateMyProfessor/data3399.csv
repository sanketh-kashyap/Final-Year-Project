Kathleen  Stetz,Seattle Pacific University,Nursing department, Seattle, WA,0,4.8,N/A,2.5,,2,05/14/2009,USEM1000,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I loved my USEM class with her. At first I was upset because she is definitely one of the hardest profs for USEM, but ultimately it was so worth it. She is so intelligent and nice. My class has had dinner at her numerous times (even quarters later when the class is over). Be prepared to work and learn. She is great."

She really cares about the students and how everyone does. Her class was an easy A. There was virtually no work involved (it was a two credit class) and no final exam, just a presentation. She doesn\'t grade harsh at all. If you do the work, you basically get an A. Great teacher."
