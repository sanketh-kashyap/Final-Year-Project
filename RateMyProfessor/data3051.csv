Always available for help. As for the class itself, you make your own grade, so to speak. Do all the homework, show up for class, take the tests and you will pass the class. You get out of it what you put into it. Hoping to take again in future."

Take this guy if you\'re not very good at math and need someone who will take the time to explain things. Plus his classes are sorta fun.

He more goes over powerpoints and when he tries to do math problems he always makes mistakes & the students have to correct him. He\'s always looking confused. He should be fired. Why & how did he even get hired in the first place?

Mr. Conners is a great teacher, I can actually stay awake and focused during the lesson. He takes the time to help his students and wants to see them succeed."

He is a great teacher, he spices math up with quirky stories and makes it not as tedious. And he makes fun of this website! I highly recommend him as a teacher. He works with his students and makes sure they are comfortable with the material."

He can tell when we need some time to let everything sink in and start making sense. He is also genuinely concerned as to how each student is progressing and is more than willing to give individual help if needed. I would recommend Dan to anyone.

When he tries to solved a problems, 90% of them he gets them wrong."
