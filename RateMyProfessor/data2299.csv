YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,Grades heavily on attendance - once even marked attendance 10 minutes before class was scheduled to start and marked everyone who came \'late\' as tardy. Lectures are long and monotonous. Heavy amount of reading and assignments assigned each week - be prepared to spend at least a few hours doing the weekly homework..

Unless you don\'t turn in your homework and miss classes, you\'ll be fine."
