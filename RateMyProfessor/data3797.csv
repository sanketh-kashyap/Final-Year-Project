His accent is a little heavy but still easy to understand and explains everything well, always makes jokes. Quizes every other week but theyre easy and keep you up on the material. He actually makes it fairly easy to learn compared to other teachers, would totally have him again."

Very fair and truly wants students to learn a lot and receive a good grade in the class. Exams are open text book and comparable to the HW problems, sometimes the same. Not sure why all the other bad ratings, one of the better professors I\'ve had"

The professor is difficult to understand. He has an unreasonable expectation to have an assignment due at the beginning of every class. Also, the syllabus stated one project, but our class was given two. I would recommend taking Cobourn or Brehob."
