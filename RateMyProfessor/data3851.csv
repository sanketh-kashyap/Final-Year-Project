She answers emails right away, provides great explanations for tough problems, actively participates in the discussion boards, and genuinely cares about students and wants them to succeed. She assigns lots of homework, but is good at helping to understand it."

Accounting does not come very easily to me, but Prof Havens broke all of my homework problems down so that I could see where I was making mistakes and how to fix them. Having a professor invest the amount of time and effort into students as she does is far too rare of a thing. I learned so much in her class."

Professor Havens was fantastic, really seemed to care, and did everything she could to help me pass the class. I failed, and retook the class with a Professor that just didnt\' care at all, and the difference is amazing."
