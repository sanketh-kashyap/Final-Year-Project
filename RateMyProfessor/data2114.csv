One half the semester the other the other half the semester. Dont take over the summer its much more difficult than it has to be, probably because you only meet 10 times. She is not all organized but fair. She doesnt talk to much on the material. The book was NEVER used by me. Pass classJust study hard."

Vague and acts like she does not like teaching. Test questions are too advanced. The best teachers are the ones that enjoy what they are doing. Not sure about Shaffer.
