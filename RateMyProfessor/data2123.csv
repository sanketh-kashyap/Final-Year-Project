Every paper and project was focused on that, it got so bad at the end because most people could care less about environmental change. He\'s a somewhat easy grader, but it very unclear with the directions of pretty much everything. Vaguely describes how to do projects them marks you down for things"

His test are fairly easy, including the final which is open book, open notes. There are only 4 papers, the longest being 1200 words. I expected to get a C in the class but got an A. If you have to take Engl250, take Mr. B if you can."
