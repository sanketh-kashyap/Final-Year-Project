You literally do not acquire any knowledge from sitting through them and as long as you stay on top of your prelabs and lab reports you should never ever have to actually attend a lecture to succeed.

His hubris and arrogance is unparalleled in my experience and he is incredibly rude and unhelpful in person. He spends half his lectures talking up his own research and book."
