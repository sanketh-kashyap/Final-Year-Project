YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,0,"Really easy class as long as you pay attention. She gives study guides for the tests. The homework can be done like an hour to thirty minutes before class,but I mean you should probably do it the day she assigned it so that you don\'t have to worry about it later."

Of course I was the oldest student in a class of Soar Students haha. Easy class just show up.

Will teach you how to write a research paper in MLA format, which is needed for many, if not all of the classes students will take at AVC. Awesome information for conducting library research. Easy work, a couple journals, a bibliography, no paper!"
