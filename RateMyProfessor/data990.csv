All of his test except the final are take-home. You take 3 tests and the final than he drops the lowest of the four. His accent iss a little difficult to understand. Always agree with him and laugh at his jokes. Really cool guy.

But Dr. Akintude made the course fun and enjoyable. Very Funny and cares about the students. Exams are very fair, but that\'s only if you attend class and read the book. If you do what is expected there\'s no doubt in my mind that you\'ll be exempt from the final and get an A. Highly Recommended."

But then again, I\'m easily amused. His tests were so easy, just study what lines he told you to memorize. He curves the tests like crazy. But if you don\'t pay attention, he kind of... picks on you that day."
