Doesn\'t speak English well, but if you are a friendly person she will like you and even help you on assessments. She\'s pretty lenient but don\'t take that for granted bc we do a lot online & there\'s only so much wiggle room in regards to that. I have enjoyed her class so much! I\'m not a language person so I really had to study hard"

By far the best Italian teacher here. She\'s really funny and easy. She doesn\'t speak english well but it doesn\'t matter she\'s amazing. If you have a choice definitely take Italian with her.

She doesn\'t speak english well so understanding her is sometimes a problem, but the message always comes through. Laughs at everything and only gets frustrated if you really don\'t pay attention. I learned a lot of Italian, but it depends how much work you put into it."
