Antoine  Bargel,University of Oregon,Languages department, Eugene, OR,3,2.7,N/A,4.3,,3,01/20/2012,FRNCH301,5.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Antoine was one of my favorite French professors during my time at Oregon. His classes were very engaging and he expected the best from each student. He was very passionate about the material that he presented and inspired me to become a better French student. I wish I could have more classes taught by Antoine.

I studied all the time and normally had been a good friend student, especially good at essay writing - which he gave me Cs on all my essays. He was useless when I went to get help and he didn\'t seem to enjoy teaching. He grades realllly hard!!"
