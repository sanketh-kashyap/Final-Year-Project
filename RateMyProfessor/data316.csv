Really helpful with Grad school applications!

Extremely engaging and really has the students best interest in mind. I plan on taking every class that I can with Lentz. She gets to know each and every student and is always there to help. A new and interesting approach to teaching which is someone that McGill is usually lacking. Do everything you can to take a class with Lentz.
