We met only once a week, so the attendance is CRUCIAL! We did not have a textbook (that\'s was a relief); she provided us with articles on CANVAS. We did not have much homework, and when we did, it was very easy (reflect on questions, experiences). She cares about each student, just ask!"

If you don\'t do the reading, you\'re going to fail. She lectures the entire time and all of the info is in the textbook. I don\'t even bother taking notes. I just read the chapters and I\'ve gotten an A on all the tests."
