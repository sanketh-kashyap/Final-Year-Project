I did not think he had the greatest interest in giving us our time and money worth. When we received our papers back there was just a grade-no comments-like he didn\'t even grade them. School is very expensive for me-I did not appreciate the lack of thought.

He will adjust the lesson plans accordingly to the class. Does not make attendance mandatory. Very Easy class. Lecture notes and weekly quizzes are easy as well. I recommend this class if you are looking for an easy A. Very nice guy, a lot of stories to tell to make you understand the less"
