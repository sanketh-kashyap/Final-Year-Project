I probably worked harder in this class than almost any other literature/writing-based course. Wow! But it was worth it. Dr. Rodriguez is an interesting guy, and the class actually helped me to finally appreciate poetry. I think he\'s gone from NAU now? Not sure. Too bad, I really enjoyed that class."

He\'s a good teacher and knows his stuff, but he is a hard grader. I got a low grade for my rough drafts and I followed all the corrections and still got a C. If you really like English and writing take this class, if not take something easier!"

Challenging but fun. Rodriguez in genuinely interested in what the student have to say, and I could listen to him talk all day!"
