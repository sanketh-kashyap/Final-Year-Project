Lectures made otherwise boring material somewhat interesting. Does a good job explaining and telling you what to study for each test. Even if you don\'t read it will be hard not to get a B. Really no negative things to say!

She made such a boring topic so interesting because she\'s so funny! She makes the class fun and I never dread going to it. It was generally very easy as long as you do a little studying for the tests but she will tell you what is exactly on the test. DEFF TAKE! EASY A IF YOU TRY!

She makes learning a lot of fun! Make sure your on top of your stuff, but she is without a doubt one of the best teachers I have ever had!"

The concepts and topics she focuses on are those that she knows from personal experience are important in the business world. She is very easy going with the students, but makes clear what she expects. She made a 3 hour class tolerable with her sense of humor and energy. Highly recommended!"

In honesty, it was too easy. I would dread going to this class. It was extremely boring. Class consisted of lecture (barely opened book in class). I felt like I barely learned anything useful. If you want an easy A or B take this class. If you actually want to learn something, take another professor."
