Her method for grading is very systematic. My interest in the subject was minimal so I didn\'t expect much going in. If you show up and do all of the assignments then you\'ll pass, but don\'t expect an easy ""A""."

She wants her students to think clearly and critically and be able to communicate well using academic writing. Jess is firm but fair in her expectations from her students. My writing is definitely improving. Prof. Wilson motivated me to work harder at and to take an honors course for Writing 102."

Good teacher!

She is very helpful when you need it. She gave a quiz once a week but it was over stuff you read so it was easy. Very understanding teacher
