His handwriting sucks. His jokes are not funny. His lecture is boring. He takes in class quiz when most people are not in class. His TA who called Mike is happy to take mark from you on your assignment, and lab report. I quit EE because this prof"

He\'s very passionate about what he does, and does it well! Brown applies the course to reality to see how it is really used. He\'s very approachable, and will drop what he\'s doing to help you out. Highly recommended!"
