In class time is spent hearing him read stories, but also gives great writing advice. By far my favorite English teacher out of all the years of middle/high school/college."

I forgot the first assignment and he let me email it to him the next day for full credit. Really laid back, my only issue is that the entire class he spends reading papers or Stephen King passages. That is in no way a deal breaker though, I wish all my professors were like him!"

He is funny, down to earth, and a very easy grader. There is 1 assignment each week, but nothing that is too crazy. Most assignments are no longer than 200 words! If you\'re looking for an easy A then this is the class to take!"

I learned nothing like how to correct my errors on my papers. All he talked about was Stephen King. Easy work but useless.

The time that isn\'t spent like that is spent either reading from Stephan King or clearing his throat obnoxiously. Not bad if you want an easy grade, but annoying if you actually expected to be taught."
