I was very nervous about taking this class as math is not my strong suit. She made things make sense and was available to help at any time I had questions. If youdo your homework you will pass this class.

She teaches only through the book, not coursecompass... way better!! does give homework daily but i\'m in a 8 week class. if you aren\'t great in math like myself, she is the perfect teacher."
