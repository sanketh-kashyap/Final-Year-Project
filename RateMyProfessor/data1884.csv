He is a really nice guy, and really funny, but he is pretty unorganized. He really wants you to learn the stuff he teaches, so you do it over and over."

He announces very little of what is to be done inside and outside of class, his exams rarely cover the content of the class. I\'ve visited his offices hours and got no help from him. If he continues to teach higher level french courses, i plan to drop my minor. his class is a waste of money."

He was unclear with how he wanted things turned in and how he wanted them done. He acted like school is the only responsibility students have and would post homework or changes to homework after the last class of the week with few days to complete an assignment that took several hours.

Hounfodji expects a lot out of his students & is willing to give a lot in return. He is fair & will give you the grade you deserve. I would take another class with him. Good sense of humor...makes class fun.

He is very unclear when teaching and is inconsistent about course expectations. His grading for a basic 300 level class is ridiculous and also inconsistent. Do yourself a favor and take another professor for ANY class he teaches."
