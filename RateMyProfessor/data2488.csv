He gives off this whimsical charm that is impossible to hate. He is a rather hard marker, but he assists you with what you\'re struggling with, and if take his feedback you\'ll do well. He makes his lectures pretty fun in an otherwise boring class. He\'s hilarious and brilliant. Hope have him again"

Has a great sense of humor & very approachable. He doesn\'t make his students feel like theyre dumb even if you do make a mistake. Its like we\'re equals.

That is assuming you can handle and are not offended by his obvious and never ending sexual innuendo throughout the course. That is also assuming you are a female thus having no problem with 75% of the course being based on the ""female experience"" and how terrible the male gender is. Other than that he marks hard as well."

He has a very laid back personality, but don\'t mistake it for an easy marker. He is very fair in assignments and marking. Makes class super enjoyable and is great with one on one help, I\'d take a class with him again in a second, amazing prof :)"

He is brilliant and genuinely funny. The fact that he doesn\'t have a full time job at U of C is crazy considering some of the terrible profs I\'ve had in this department. He made a spring course, normally a drag, something to look forward to. So laid back yet still motivates you to do well and expects that you engage."

By far the best English prof I have had at the U of C. A very entertaining man and very knowledgable. He helped me a lot with my writing and improved me as a writer. Despite being a Maple Leafs fan, he is a good prof. Very highly recommended. :)"

He has a great sense of humour and an out of the box approach to English. Very insightful and challenging. I\'ve learned a lot from him.

If you are struggling in his class, you need to let him know and then go and see him. He is committed to supporting his students as long as they show initiative. Here\'s hoping he\'ll be teaching in Calgary for many years."
