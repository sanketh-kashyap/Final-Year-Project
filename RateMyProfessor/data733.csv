Her class was very interesting, I learned so much just by attending her class. I wish I could have taken Arabic II with her. Oh she speaks 4 languages not 5."

She is able to speak 7 different languages fluently. She has an M.D. and on top of that a P.H.D in Arabic. She is very tough when it comes to Homework and Tests. But If you have an interest in learning a new language than take her class.
