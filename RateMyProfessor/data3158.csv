Sandra  Yost,University of Detroit Mercy,Engineering department, Detroit, MI,0.0,1.3,N/A,5.0,,2,12/31/2009,EE388,1.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"This professor is the reason that I want to change my major. She taught 3 of my classes in 1 semester in which I had to teach myself EVERYTHING. Would make us sit in a classroom across from her on Wimba even though UDM\'s bandwidth is not large enough. Didn\'t prepare me for later classes whatsoever. I cannot believe that she still ""teaches"" at UDM."

She absolutely teaches nothing, period. Plan on hours of self teaching. No examples and relies on ""Wimba"" for her dumb on-line lectures. Stay away from Yost if you care about your education and life!!!!!!!!"
