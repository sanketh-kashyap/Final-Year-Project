The class is pretty easy to not show up to or pay attention in but I promise you won\'t pass if you don\'t pay close attention because the tests are impossible without it. Learn from my mistake!

Her final exam was brutal and she looked for particular terminology rather than concepts. Also, she penalized for correct answers if they were not exactly the issue she was looking for. As for class, you have to show up and not zone off to pass her class with a decent grade."
