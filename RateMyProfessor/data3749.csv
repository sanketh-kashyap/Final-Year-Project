He was unusually enthusiastic and utilized 100% of the time allocated for each class. He was particularly proficient at translating the subject matierial into ""real world"" usefulness. I learned more than I had hoped to in his class."

Really knows how to teach math while making it fun. Math is not my best class and I never thought I would say that a math class was fun but it sort of was. Bruce has a way of making math seem easy. He never gets mad even when some students ask really dumb questions. If you are not good in math, take this class from him."

Extremely knowledgeable and likes to answer questions from students. I thought this was going to be a boring class after looking at the textbook but Bruce made it a fun class. Explained many things that were not very well covered by the book or not covered at all.
