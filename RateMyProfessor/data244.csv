TEST HEAVY  LOTS OF HOMEWORK,0,0,There us a language barrier which can make it difficult to understand her clearly. Her lecture are not very interesting and her powerpoint notes aren\'t very helpful. She has a lot of quizzes which are multiple choice. The exams are very poorly done. Study hard for them and pay attention to lecture for tests. The take home labs are very easy.

As long as you do your work (even with very little effort) you should get an A no problem. She answers questions and emails back rather quickly. She had no midterm either.

She grades fairly, and is helpful if you ever have a problem. Be aware though that you will need weekly lap reports of 4 pages or so, as well as 6-10 pages of data questions and questions. Overall, good teacher though."

Although relatively easy class she is hard to understand and a bit impatient when answering questions. Her office hours are slim, but she is willing to communicate through email pretty well.

The class can be an easy A buy you actually have to keep up. Quizzes & labs are often but easy. Two easy projects. Mid-term & final are kinda tough..study! She knows what she is talking about; her accent might get in the way of understanding. She\'s really nice too. I would for sure take her for any other classes that Ineed.
