Will give you a hard time when it comes to be long late; even if its 10 min. Hes not empathetic to any excuses. But does have a absent rule. You cannot be on your phone and no pictures of the notes, We had to get 3 and only used 1 sometimes"

He\'s really cool, just do your work, show up to class and the best of all its that there\'s only 2 essays in the class and a research paper of only 6 pages. Not bad compared to other history classes. Don\'t use your cell phone and if you show up late just send him an email. Great class and energy."

He wakes you up; loud teacher. My boyfriend took his class before me; when I got his class, he embarrassed me. As long as you go to class, not be late (15 minutes; close the door), return everything on time (he has specific dates and times), and NOT TEXT IN CLASS. Your\'ll be fine."

When asked a simple question, he got defensive and didn\'t answer it. He yells through the entire class. At 8 AM this is hard to stomach so early in the morning. He is unreasonably strict about attendence, being on time, and assignments. He gives low grades for small mistakes. Spare yourself."

Most of the time he has sand in his v*gina and releases his bottled up rage on a poor student who isn\'t disrupting the class at all. Also, miss his class for 6 days and you\'re out,no joke. In my opinion, he was bullied before and now the roles have been reversed."

Nice teacher, and not overloaded with a lot of work."
