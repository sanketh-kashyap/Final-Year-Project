He is extremely unorganized and does not explain exactly how he wants you to write your papers. He is an extremely unfair grader.

I loved his class and feel like I learned a lot more in his class than I ever have in an english class. The only problem I had in his class is he expects you to speak up and really take part in class discussions. So it becomes a problem if you are shy like I am. But overall GREAT professor!
