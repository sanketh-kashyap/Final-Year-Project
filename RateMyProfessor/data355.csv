Can be somewhat unorganized at times. Lectures seemed to go off topic often but she seems able to control the class. Excellent speaking clarity. Work load seemed average for an English class. Keep in mind, writing assignments generally take longer than other assignments. Show progress & do your best and you\'ll receive 4.00"

If you need English 101 I highly recommend her. She is very helpful and laid back, not anal like most teachers I\'ve had.
