I took one of her classes last semester and I\'m in another now. Will probably take more in the future. Very clear and easy to understand lectures, gives extensive feedback on papers, and a nice person. You can tell she is very passionate about art history."

There isn\'t much daily work but when the papers hit they can hit hard if you haven\'t put the effort in. She is a little intimidating, but she is really understanding and sweet when you do talk to her."

Also, expect for it to be one of the harder classes you\'ll take at Oberlin. She\'s incredible smart, but if she gets the sense you\'re not in the class one hundred percent you\'re not in a good position. Stay on her good side! And you will learn A TON!"

After each paper, she gives in-depth critiques of what to improve on... getting an A is extremely tough, but she offers generous office hours and extra review sessions before exams. A kind, engaging, sensible professor overall."
