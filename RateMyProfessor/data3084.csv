If you\'re a theatre major you have to take this course anyway, so bring your laptop and don\'t let him see you\'re really on facebook the whole time. Good luck to you."

The only thing that you should waste your time on in this class is the papers... but mediocre papers still get A\'s as long as the bullet points are in there somewhere. Bring Coffee or a pillow. Good luck and god speed

There is a ton of outside work and I learned absolutely nothing. Dr. D is easily agitated and I hated every second of his class.

His lectures are boring and long, and his reading quizzes have questions that are debatable. The tests are easy as long as you study the vocab. You\'ll do fine on the the reading quizzes if you just read sparknotes, so don\'t bother buying the plays."

His method is simply to talk down to the class to convince students that he knows what he\'s talking about, unfortunately big words don\'t necessarily mean any meaningful analysis. Not worth your time, you won\'t learn anything."

Being talked to like I\'m three feels really great. *sarcasm* I hate this class with a passion and would give anything to get out of having to take it. The man really loves the sound of his own voice and feeling like he\'s the most intelligent person in the room.
