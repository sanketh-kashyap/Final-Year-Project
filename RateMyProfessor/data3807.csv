I wanted to think that he actually cared about the students, but the way he acted did not seem to match what he said. He likes to ramble instead of directly answering questions, and I feel like my intro to worship band class with him was a complete joke. However, I relaly enjoyed the textbook."

Willing to go over concepts with you over and over again until you understand. Take him if you are interested in learning to play the guitar, improve your skills or just need elective credit."
