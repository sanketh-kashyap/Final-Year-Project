Condescending, forgetful, snobbish and just plain terrible. Usually, when my peers don\'t like a professor I assume it\'s because they\'re a tough grader, but our mutual disdain for her was completely her own doing. I\'ve never had a teacher scoff and roll her eyes at students\' ideas before."

She is only for real college students. Her expectations are college level, so don\'t expect to be babied, for example pay attention in class, take notes, keep track of dates and assignments, READ, do your work. I\'ve taken her twice and only got an A once, she makes you earn your grade, not given."

Period.\xc2\xa0She showed me how to be a college student and how to be successful. \xc2\xa0Her class has meaning. Not trying to win a popularity contest like the other english teachers. She keeps it real. Maybe because she really is a writer. Off the chart good.

Great open discussions of EL+IC. This is the first English class at Mission where it felt like a real college course. Challenging in a good way.

She would often tell us to refer to the syllabus instead of asking her questions when she had plenty of time to answer us. When we refer to the syllabus it still made no sense then she would tell us to refer to our colleagues. I would ask my colleagues and they didn\'t understand either.

I have taken her for every class since eng 21. Her classes have lots of group work and intertesting talks about the readings. She tries really hard to help everyone understand what to do.
