Her exams are ok. She wants her students to understand chemistry. Most people dont understand her but if you dont, than just drop the class. Read the textbook, do as many problems as you can and you should be fine."

She tries to help her students as much as she can, if you need help talk to her. I mostly taught myself in that class and at the end I received an A. I would recommend her she is not a hard teacher and an easy grader."

I only went to four classes (three were exam days), but i hear she preferences those who attend class. I got a 68, 84, 64 on my exams, and I think a 70 on the final. I ended up getting a B in the class, pretty nice curve. She gives extra questions/lets you show work for credit also. I\'d say take her over brown."

I don\'t think that the professor makes a difference. language barrier is tough so plan on learning a lot on your own. Tests are ok. Listen to what she says the lecture before the test. She appreciates in-class particiaption and seeing you often. This may help your grade in the end. However she does not take attendance

SHE WILL CONFUSE YOU! Her tests are usually based of of Browns exams. HORRIBLE TEACHER. DOESNT KNOW WHAT SHE IS TALKIN ABOUT

The information she tells you is inaccurate half the time. Enjoys playing tricks on you, resulting in lower quiz grades. Avoid her recitation, it will NOT help you at all."
