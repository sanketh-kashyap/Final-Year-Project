He swears ""F"" words in the class and will not listen to you. His assignments are very hard. I will not recommend this teacher to anyone. Worst Teacher ever in UMASS Lowell. No matter how hard you work on homework or assignments he will give you less than ""C"" grade."

He will push you to make your writing better, but honestly I didn\'t really ask for that in this class. He\'s a difficult grader and I spent most of my time working on this class than in my major ones! Avoid him if you are looking to just pass and get over with your gen eds. I got a B, I probably deserved an A"

He will really go into your essay and make your writing better. He grades your draft and then you can make your final paper a whole lot better. He really is a good teacher."

Miss one check = 0 on the final = F for course. I missed the first check. Technically my fault, but a RECKLESS POLICY. The worst part is he said NOTHING for the ENTIRE SEMESTER. I was blindsided when grades were posted. No response to my emails. A real-life nightmare."

There a lot of papers and a lot of readings. One big paper you write throughout the sesmester and if he doesn\'t like your opinion he doesn\'t give you a good grade. I hated this class it was awful! do not take!

If youre not his fav (a comic book junkie like him) then you wont get as good a grade. Makes lame jokes. Averaged 2 papers a week for this guy. Dont take the class if you dont have to.

Instead of using text books like other classes he used novels that were actually interesting including MAUS. Class discussions were always interesting and no tests. Definitely worth taking a class with him just be prepared to improve your writing.
