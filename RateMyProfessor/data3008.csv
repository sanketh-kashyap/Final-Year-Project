He\'s also never around besides when he teaches the class, so you can\'t get help from him. However, he lets you redo the projects until you get them right"

The assignments are easy and fun, but at times can get a little time consuming. Try to take notes. Good GPA booster"

He is very knowledgeable with AutoCAD. I highly recommend his course if you need to learn AutoCAD. If you already know it than don\'t take it cause he goes over foundation principles of the program.
