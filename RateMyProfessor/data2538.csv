He is not very helpful, in fact not at all. I had asked for assistance and he referred me to asking other students. Students who were struggling just as much as myself. Very disappointing, he does not engage in the course and his feedback for assignments is misleading and lacking."

I felt as though he really didn\'t want to teach the class and he did not offer any additional discussion to the topics. While I received a good grade, it was not because of his teachings. Very disappointed with his lack of engagement."

He is more of a facilitator than a teacher, though. Don\'t expect much personalized praise. Still, he will quickly answer your questions and knows his subject-totally. The assignments aren\'t too tough, but the ""concept paper"" needs to be lengthy. It counts as a big percentage of your class grade. Good luck!"

His lectures are better than the textbook, and he knows his subject. I think he\'s quite busy, though, so he doesn\'t offer much personalized feedback. It\'s more copy-and-paste. Still, he will answer any question in a decent amount of time and has a good e-course layout. I\'d recommend him and/or take him again."
