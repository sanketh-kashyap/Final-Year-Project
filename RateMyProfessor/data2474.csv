Silvia  Benso,Rochester Institute of Technology,Philosophy department, Rochester, NY,6,3.7,N/A,3.1,TEST HEAVY (1)  Get ready to read (1)  Participation matters (1),9,12/03/2016,PHIL201,3.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,No,Not,TEST HEAVY  GET READY TO READ  PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,It\'s a 200 level class and it\'s too serious with no group work. I met zero classmates. Attendance only allows 6 absences. There are five extensive discussion pieces. All exam questions require a response of 500 or 750 words each Q. She is passionate and loves to talk about her cat.. I think RIT students leave her at a loss for words sometimes.

Slight Italian accent, a pleasure to listen to. Really made me think about issues I had never thought about. Very helpful explanations of at times difficult texts. Requires regular reading and note-taking. Fair exams. She truly has a passion for her subject matter, and is very enthusiastic. Open-minded, listens to every opinion."

Hard to understand at times. She teachers Philosophy as if it were a history class. Hard to get an A because of how few graded assignments there are. She is always late to class. Most classes are boring, circular discussions that are never clarified."

Terribly boring, and sparks painful discussions, but dismisses any opinion that conflicts with her own. Occasional misinformation. Poor grading scheme: Everything is worth the percentage points its worth in your final grade, but she almost exclusively deducts whole points."

Class is fairly easy, just listen and take good notes and read the readings you\'ll do fine. Grades based on 2 response papers attendance and 2 take home tests. No final. Take home tests are fairy challenging, response papers are easy As as long as you explain yourself"

Lectures are very interesting, although the books we were asked to buy were not really needed since she pointed out quotes and went over everything in the readings each class. I rated her class as hard because the only work we turned in was two responses, a midterm, and a final, so an A is hard to get!"

Benso is an intelligent professor and speaks the material well, but phenomenology is just hard stuff to grasp. That is the only reason my easiness rating is medium."
