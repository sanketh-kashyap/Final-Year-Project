He is a nice and easy going professor. Usually weekly assignments that are about 12 a page to 1 page long. A lot of reading in front of the class but it\'s not presentation format just sitting there and reading what you wrote for 30 seconds. This is a great opportunity to get creative with every single assignment.

Great guy, super nice, hilarious... just a good guy... Looked forward to class every day. Yes it\'s an easy A, but don\'t take advantage of him... he\'s a good guy! Projects were easy and enjoyable. Tom Clack was great too. Lots of great stories. I recommend this class and this professor."

Has small assignments due every week, which are pretty much graded A unless handed in late or in incorrect format. Along that one midterm and one final, both relatively simple. We watch some cool movies too. A fun and creative class overall, and EASY A."

There are assignments due almost every friday, but they are pretty easy and he grades them easily. He usually lets you out early everyday, and there are computers in the class room, Usually he doesn\'t even teach one or two days a week,"

He\'s got a lot of experience and he\'s really funny, as long as you aren\'t the hungover sorority chick in the back he\'s making fun of. All the sections of this class are the same material and projects, but at least he\'s amusing."
