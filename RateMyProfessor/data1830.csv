All you have to do is follow instructions and you will do well. Anyone that complains about her apparently has issues. Only teacher in the area that knows what the heck she\'s talking about. A++++

We did not get along and she made sure I didnt get my A by scoring me low enough on my final that I ended up with an 89.4 average. VERY VINDICTIVE...

She is very picky about how you show your work, but she is very helpful and pleasant. She wants you to succeed in her class. She is happy to work after class if you need extra help."
