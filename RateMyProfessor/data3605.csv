I had his online class and he made things very easy. If u take his class online make sure u do the sample quizzes and memorize everything and u will do great, if u have questions Mr. Rogers got back to me very quickly I would take his class again!"

Here\'s my impression of him during lecture: ""blah blah blah railroads and the South and the KKK blah blah blah."" He fails as a teacher."

While tests and papers were easy, the lectures were painful to endure and ultimately were not at all helpful. I stopped going to lecture and taught myself from the book and finished the semester with an A. If possible take this class from a different professor. Not enjoyable!"

Lectures were uninteresting and essentially useless, and my TA was just as bad and graded unfairly. Avoid this guy if you can unless you enjoy pointless, boring lectures. Horrible."

There were 400 people in my class and on any given day MAYBE 45% of people would be there because the lectures just werent very helpful. If you take this class prepare to teach yourself. Overall, not a difficult class."
