Susan  Chesler,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,7,3.3,N/A,4.5,Tough Grader (2)  Gives good feedback (1)  Caring (1)  Clear grading criteria (1),6,05/02/2016,WRITI1L,1.0,5.0,Mandatory,Yes,N/A,Not,TOUGH GRADER,0,1,"Constructive criticism can be very helpful in a legal writing course. However, don\'t expect to get any of that in Chesler\'s class. She is spiteful, rude, and condescending. She goes out of her way to intentionally confuse and mislead her students. Her lectures are absolutely worthless; she uses them as an opportunity to hear herself speak."

It was a difficult task to move from undergrad writing to legal writing, and she made it easy, and understandable. She does give a lot of feedback on papers, but in a way that helps you improve your writing. The more you put into this class, the more you will get out of it with her."

Her exams are difficult, and you don\'t know what issues of an essay will be worth the most. Avoid taking her if possible."
