Tonya  Dodge,Skidmore College,Psychology department, Saratoga Springs, NY,1,2.8,N/A,2.3,,3,01/12/2010,PS101,2.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Dodge is a really nice human being but an awful teacher. If you have a passion for science and enjoyed being challenged in the subject in h.s. this class will bore you to tears and will be an easy A. Her knowledge is so severely limited beyond the textbook that you might as well not show up for class. It just sucks since she\'s so unbelievably nice

She uses powerpoint slides to summarize the chapters. On her tests, she would pull one or two questions from the textbook that was not mentioned in class. But on the final she\'ll only test you on what was talked about in class. She is very generous."

Tests are pretty easy but the two major assignments she has you do are graded ridiculously. She is not clear about what she is looking for. Do not take the class if you want your grade to accurately reflect what you learned and put into the class.
