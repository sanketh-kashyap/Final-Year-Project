I enjoy math and like a challenge but he was unbearable. He would move very quickly and if you tried to ask a question he would literally laugh at you. He definitely knows his material but I\'d suggest a teacher that doesn\'t yell at you for using a calculator.

Dont take questions, cant ask your classmate for help when himself doesnt give out help. So sarcastic, when some students struggle in his class, instead of explaining he degrades their intellectual ability and mocks them. He is just worst.

The issue comes with his attitude. He is borderline manipulative. He likes to smile and joke in class, but he is very unfair on grading. He says he is looking for work, and isn\'t concerned as much about the answer, but if you do the work perfectly and get the answer wrong, he takes off half cred"

He really goes in details with each chapter however he gets irritated if you don\'t the basics of the chapter and does assign alot of homework.
