If her boyfriend didn\'t make Leonidas look like a midget, I\'d totally have asked her out after the semester was over! Oh well.. She is really helpful, super enthusiastic and really knows her stuff! Someone said her bf won all the departments scholarships or something, so I guess I better start studying and join the campus gym then retake!"

There are three exams(quizes)and they consisted of twenty questions each. The study guide she provides gives you all the info on the exams.EASY
