Ludmila  Yevsukov,Montgomery College: Rockville Campus,Russian department, Rockville, MD,1,4.8,N/A,2.7,,3,06/04/2010,RU202,4.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I have had Professor Yevsukov for four semesters, I started in Ru 101 and finished up at Ru 202. She is by far my favorite professor. Even though the classes sometimes get sidetracked, she is always willing to help a student increase their knowledge and understanding. I will greatly miss her classes."

This is the second class I\'m taking with her. Attendence is a must, but it is so worth it! She makes class fun. You can joke around when you make translations, and as long as you are attemting Russian and not saying anything rude, she\'s ok with you talking a little off subject during group disscussions. You really learn in class."

She makes the class fun, encourages interaction and is very helpful if you don\'t know something. She is very polite and never makes you feel like an idiot if you say something wrong. She will work with you on pronunciation until you get it right without making you feel stupid. She is a lot of fun, and also a fair grader"
