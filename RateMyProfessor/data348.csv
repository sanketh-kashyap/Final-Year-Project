Easy A! 1 quiz, participation, attendance, mid-term, final, and 1 paper is your grade. He tells you exactly what is on the tests, straight from his notes!!!! His class is very laid back and interactive. Show him that you care about the material and participate. Also, talk to him outside of class! Easy A."
