Makes every single person in class give their opinion on things. Assigned some essays that weren\'t graded. On the upside, has fun class discussions, though that could be credited to the students"

If you wish to study black issues and feminist issues take her. But the college does offer other classes that are directly in volved with those type of issues. If you like to be bombarded with those kind of issues take this class. I hated it from day one. She\'s not very structured and all o
