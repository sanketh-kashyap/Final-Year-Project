It does not feel like she\'s lecturing you. Also, after she grades and hands back your paper, you are able to use her feedback notes to correct any mistakes and turn it back in for a NEW GRADE that is guaranteed to be higher. EASY A!"

She\'s a fantastic lecturer, and she made it a point to get to know all eight of us in the class. She has a high standard for the work she receives, but she is a very fair grader and will help you out if need direction. I really liked the journal time before class, too. Grade-A prof."
