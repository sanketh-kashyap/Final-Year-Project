Only good thing about class is there usually isn\'t any on Friday. Very very hard class.

Two assignments a week, which are usually pretty annoying but a lot of them are really time-consuming."

She gives you hard tests, but there is a lot of easy home work to help out your grade. She was always very helpful to me."

Not an impossible class, but will take time if you want at least a B. The test are hard but you do other work that is easy to make up for hard test."

I actually liked Econ 201 and I got in this class and absolutely hated it just because of her. She is rude and calls you out in class for no reason. She was suppose to curve all of our tests and our final but I dont think that ever happened.

If she is your only option, take Econ somewhere else or wait unitl the next semester if possible. I somehow made it out with a B..but i dont know how!! That class was crazy hard! Just plain ridiculous! Im in Chemistry now and its nowhere near as hard! I took Econ 201 with Figgins...easy A!!! She was a hateful a$$!!"
