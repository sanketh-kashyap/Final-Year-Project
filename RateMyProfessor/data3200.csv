This is a college class, not the Tonight Show where you expect to be entertained.I found the class very rewarding. This professor is extremely well-prepared, and yes, soft-spoken. To do well, you have to study hard, that\'s it."

""Answers"" questions with questions. Awful reading material assigned as though students have no other obligations or classes except hers. Tests are akin to a bad joke. Having a graduate degree doesn\'t mean one can or should be teaching. Effectively squashes any interest in IR/IC you have before taking her class. Stay away."

It\'s true that she knows her African politics and conflicts, but THAT\'S IT! She has no knowledge of conflicts elsewhere in the world. Two tests of two essays each and one 7-10pg paper at the end.She\'s very nice, but she is too shy for the job.Her classes are pretty boring."

Acts like a child trying to present in front of the class. The class was about international conflict and when a student asked ""what\'s the u.s foreign policy,"" she did NOT KNOW THE ANSWER! More than half the class dropped her, including me. Reading material is boring and useless. She really should not be allowed to teach."

She do not speak fluently, she knows the subject, but do not know how to say it. The final paper is long too. So take her if u r just taking one class and have time for long readin"

A loooooot of reading, and assignments. she should understand that we have other courses in which we have to read books too. The course requirements are too strict,"
