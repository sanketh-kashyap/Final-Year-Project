Explains everything clearly, doesn\'t load you up with unnecessary information. Very funny , outgoing and just COOL!. I wish he would be our lecture professor. Take him you won\'t regret. I know I didn\'t."

Gave extra credit by the end of the semester. I got an A in the class. Cons- very disorganized. OWLs are a pain in the rear. I didn\'t have him for lab, but I heard that his labs are tough. If you end up in his class, don\'t worry. It\'s doable."

He lectures VERY quickly. I thank OWL and youtube videos for getting me through this awful class. He is NOT helpful. Who gives a cumulative exam with no study guide? He sets you up to fail and lacks compassion for his students who are genuiney trying to learn."

""TEST out of Chem 60"" That makes no sense. And he teaches at more than one campus, and at my campus, he\'s teaching Chem 65. And btw, I have an A in the class. I rated him as easy if you check again. He is still not a great teacher. He\'s adequate at best, if you\'re a complete moron. You\'re probably one of his brown-nosers."

The student who made the comment below mine was obviously a slacker with a great imagination. If you feel you are smarter than him why didn\'t you TEST out of chem 60? I would recommend him to anyone who wants to learn. He teaches at a a level for everyone to understand.

Has favorites, has moody days, disrespectful & insensitive. I CONSTANTLY had to correct his mistakes in class, and he obviously took great offense to it because I\'m smarter than him. Also, he has a thick accent, making him completely incomprehensible. I <3 Chem, but he made me hate it. DO NOT TAKE HIM (unless it\'s necessary)"
