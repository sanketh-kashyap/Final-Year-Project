Everything you write might as well be plagiarism. A lot of in class quizzes. She gives you plenty of schoolwork, which is fine. A lot of people, including myself dropped her class after the first essay. I have no advice other than not to take her. It is impossible to receive a good grade because she is a totalitarian grader."

I had her for freshman english and she riped us to pieces. she is very strict when grading and does not care about your feelings in what she writes on your papers. she knows a lot about english and grammar adn expects the student to as well. very hard. i don\'t recommend her.

Takes off points for font when font is not specified. You should be able to write multiple papers for this class at once."
