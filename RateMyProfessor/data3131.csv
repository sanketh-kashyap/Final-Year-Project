You are told you must buy the book (@$180) and then we never used, not once! Grades ridiculously hard, loves giving C\'s, completely unorganized, doesn\'t post grades to the website, expects you to like his FB page, and don\'t expect a light workload, he assigns tons of homework but its not graded 80% the time, and you don\'t get it back again."

He grades papers based on if he likes you or not. I went to the ASC and got approvals on my essays and I would earn 80% and no reason was given as to why. He thinks he is above everyone, and don\'t even think about proving him wrong. That\'s probably what did it for me. He will show no sympathy."

Prior to writing the papers he gives small exercises to make you comfortable w/ the paper format as well as helping you come up w/ topics. My grammer and puncuation has improved a great deal since taking his class! Turn in all your rough drafts-definitely worth it and attend every class.

We had to write 3 papers during the semester and read a book (graphic novel). He was very helpful and made sure we all understood the assignments. I also liked that we didn\'t use a traditional textbook but read a comic!! Come to class and do the homework!

Takes himself far too seriously, would not recommend him. This teacher will not take late papers if there was supposed to be an in-class critic. His grading system on Blackboard was messy and difficult to keep track of, and had to badger him about getting the grades in at all."
