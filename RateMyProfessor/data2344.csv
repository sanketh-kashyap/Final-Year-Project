Helena  Kilz,John Jay College of Criminal Justice,French department, New York, NY,0,2.3,N/A,3.2,,5,12/14/2009,FRE101,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Prof. Kilz is sweet, but a horrible professor. When she speaks, it is very unclear. She speaks french far too rapidly and makes it extremely difficult to comprehend. She refuses to translate her french orders into english. Her exmas are six to seven pages long. You should really stay away from this professor. Honestly."

NOT ANYMORE. Kilz is sweet but she ONLY speaks in french and she refuses to translate anything. I learned more in one day at the french lab listening to rosetta-stone than three months with Kilz. Oh and you CANNOT leave the room. You wont learn anything, i guarantee you this. Do not take her."

She confuses you alot, and jumps from one thing to the next. Shes all over the place with her work. If this is your first time learning french I advise you to take another professor."

She gives 4 exams, and drops the lowest grade, do HW, participate, and you should be good."

The work is pretty fair, and tests are easy b/c she actually helps a little and does a review right before it. She has an accent but still very understandable. She understands you\'re learning a new language so she backs up and slows down when necessary."
