Bev  Evans,Illinois Central College,Psychology department, East Peoria, IL,0,5.0,N/A,1.0,,1,08/10/2010,PSY114,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Bev was extremely organized for an online class...simple, clear, precise..tests were out of the book...and gives you an assignment that challenges you to do something you have never done before and write a paper on it..which was a pain in the rear, but in the end, I was so glad she did it!! Highly recommend her!"
