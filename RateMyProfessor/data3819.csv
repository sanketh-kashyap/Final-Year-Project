Not helpful at all. Was so rude when asked for help. Grading is terrible. Do not take!

I tried writing a review that described how he has no sense of consistency in grading or ability to remember anything longer than two minutes, but I had no room. Talking to him in his office is like talking to a brick wall. Nothing will help you. I can only offer my condolences."

I think the reviews that are negative are probably due to a lack of putting in the time needed. He is very helpful and WILL always take the time to explain things to you. If you are going to ask questions at least attempt to answer on your own so that you can ask the right questions. Great professor!

If you\'ve forgotten what you were supposed to learn, you should refresh before taking a class by him. He is *extremely* nice and very helpful if you ask him for help. He expects you to THINK, which is honestly a first for me at this university."

You HAVE TO put in EFFORT to this lab. READ the ONLINE textbook, no normal book this sem. Work on the next lab at least 3 days before lab. Actually learn something from it. You have to pretend your a Chemist. The reports are like stories, what happened in lab? Did the test fail or succeed? Why/How? Use formulas and graphs. Bam. A"

His lecture style can sometimes be incomprehensible but talk to him outside of class and he a nice guy willing to help. Though if you take this class be prepared to do a lot of solo studying if you want to grasp the material.

Have him for O Chem Lab--terrible, not very nice, doesn\'t really tell you what he wants and takes off for stupid stuff. If you\'re taking O Chem lab, take someone else!!!!"

Egan will post a question then spend an hour debating whether or not his answer is right, without ever coming to a conclusion. I have learned nothing in his class despite my best efforts. Last class test avg was a 22/100."

This class is awful, and in conjunction with Microbiology, will probably make your eyes bleed. If you are a self-taught type learner, then this is the class for you. Otherwise, good luck, and get to know your S.I. instructor VERY well. Make sure OWL and Lab are solid."

Ochem is not an easy subject, and most people in the class are a bunch of biomedical grade point monsters who are used to memorizing facts versus learning concepts. Make use of the S.I., do OWL, and go to his office hours, and you will do well. If you won\'t put work into it, then you won\'t do well- it\'s that simple."

He\'s always asking the student questions, and if they don\'t know the answer he moves on, WITHOUT ANSWERING IT. stinks at teaching!"

He assumes a lot and expects students to know everything. DO lots of practice problems and go to the TLC!!!!
