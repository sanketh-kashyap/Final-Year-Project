Doug  Altner,United States Naval Academy,Mathematics department, Annapolis, MD,1,2.8,N/A,3.7,,6,05/13/2010,SA401,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Extremely genuine and helpful professor... always available for EI and gives great review packets for exams. Very smart, maybe too smart for teaching, but will try his best to explain something in a manner that you can understand. Highly recommended!"

Lectures are easy to follow, just pay attention and be respectful. Doesn\'t check homeworks, but does have quizes, but only after he gives the class a day to ask questions on the material, then the questions are right off the assignment list. Very accessible and helpful in E.I."

He is not helpful at all and his lectures are confusing and not consistent with the text. Depressing..."

Cant teach. He is very smart, but CANNOT share his knowledge.Appearance=SHAMEFUL. Gets dressed **** in the dark each morning. Born without ability to interact socially. Perfect for engineering or math job, NEVER teaching."
