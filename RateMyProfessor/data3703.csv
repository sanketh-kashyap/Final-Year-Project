Edward  Raimer,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Speech Communication department, Cleveland, OH,0,4.5,N/A,4.0,,1,02/09/2009,SPCH1010,4.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Dr. Raimer is very knowledgable and has been teaching speech for over 30 years though. He expects you to come to every class! If you do things the way he tells you, you will do fine. Pay attention and follow his instructions/examples. He is quite the charactor. I really enjoy this class and I hate giving speeches."
