Seems awesome for those to whom she\'s committed, but disappointing if you\'re on the outside looking in."

One of the most passionate professors about what she does at the school. She is picky but she\'ll tend to write a lot of comments on your paper but still give you a good grade.

One problem with the class is that the lab assignments are vague and she is a hard grader. If you don\'t go to class, she\'ll notice and she\'ll treat you differently. Also, pretend that you\'re interested in the subject, or she won\'t be interested in you. Pay attention in class!"
