It seemed that she found it hard to keep herself organized some days. There were a few occasions in which we repeated topics. She\'s a wonderful person, but she should probably retire soon."

Make sure to turn assignments in on time, she does not always accept them late, and then means 5 minutes after she asks them to be turned in. You can tell she is very passionate about what she teaches, and will assign readings weekly. Keep up, show up, and you\'ll be fine."
