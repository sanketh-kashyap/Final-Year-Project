He\'s super into Micro and it shows! His lectures are well thought out and interesting, but he moves a bit slow so it\'s better to podcast lectures and watch at 1.5- 2x. Otherwise, a nice guy and he covers some really interesting stuff that he connects to stuff you experience IRL. TAKE HIM FOR MICRO! Tests are clear, no tricks"

Lectures are funny, engaging, and super interesting. Even though he podcasts, I found myself going to lecture just because I genuinely enjoyed it. Not a super difficult class; he is not concerned about having students memorize, he wants you to understand concepts and appreciate the microbial world."

The lecture slides are all posted online so its easy to review and catch up with the class. The class overall isn\'t that bad just a lot of memorization really and it is fairly easy to do well on the papers as long as you put in effort. Would love to take him again!

His lectures are clear and engaging. He truly cares for his students and wants you to learn and love the material. I considered changing my career because of him. Very clear grading criteria and (small) project expectations. Take his class- any class he teaches- whenever you can.

It is helpful to have the powerpoints on hand during lecture so you can follow along and take notes if he starts going too fast."

He makes lectures less boring and more interesting and you will enjoy his sense of humor for the entire quarter. He videocasts, which is extremely helpful. He doesn\'t expect his students to show up to class and he\'ll tell you that he\'s actually surprised if you do show up :-) Final is not cumulative! Take him!"

He does still podcast. Never opened his textbook, his exams were wholly based on his lecture audio. His lecture slides are helpful but you\'ll need to be listening to what he\'s saying to really understand what\'s going on."

He is hilarious, nice, smart, and you can tell he definitely cares for his students! The topic itself did not strike me as super interesting but he definitely made going to lectures worth while!

No need to read the book but he has extra credit questions on the exams that come from the book. Very nice professor, talks fast but podcasts. 1 midterm and 1 final. He made the exam we did better on worth more :). and I thought it was pretty common to give slightly more Cs than Bs."

Cutoffs were not generous at all as roughly 1/5 of the class got A\'s and he gave out more C\'s than B\'s. Homework is deceiving - seems like it will help you but it only raises the average and ends up screwing you over because everyone does well. Material itself isn\'t too bad though...
