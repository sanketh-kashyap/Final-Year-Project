I got an A in this class, but even so, she still found a way to bring me down and make me feel incompetent! I learned absolutely nothing in this class! DON\'T TAKE HER!"

I am in honors and I had a tough time with the papers she would assign. Nothing is good enough for her! She gives feedback but way to much. If make an A she still critiques you and makes you feel incompetent.

It only met four times, so most of our work was online. Dr Harris was GREAT about replying to any questions I had and was always very helpful. This class was a LOT of work, but Dr Harris was wonderful and made a class that could have been impossible nearly easy."
