Dave  Karanen,University of Minnesota Duluth,Engineering department, Duluth, MN,2,2.2,N/A,4.0,,5,04/28/2011,IE1225,1.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Karanen is the perfect model of a downright awful teacher. He\'s vague in explanations majority of the time, swears at students, and expects you to know everything he knows after a 25 minute demo in lab. Never hands back exams, and his grading guidelines for homework are non-existent. He is frequently absent, and his enthusiasm is abysmal at best."

He does curve a lot at the very least. Unfortunelty right now there is no other option, you have to take this class with him if you\'re ME or IE major"

Goes over everything once, and if you ask later about material, he will not explain it. Expects everyone to already know everything and just throws you into labs."

He goes over topics once in class for ten minutes and if you don\'t take notes word for word you won\'t have a clue what do and then when you ask for help he gets mad that you didn\'t understand his 10 minute rant. Don\'t take him or this class!
