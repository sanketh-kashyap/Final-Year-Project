There is a lot of homework and you will fail if you don\'t do it. She allows for it to be worth half credit when turned in late. Midterm and final are multiple choice. Quizzes are step by step instructions given on how to do something on the computer.

She wants you to understand & does everything she can to help you. Show up to class, do your homework & an A or B is yours! However, not a good class if you use a MAC computer! Word for MAC is NOT the same!"
