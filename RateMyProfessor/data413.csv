Naphtalie  O\'Conner,Lehman College,Chemistry department, Bronx, NY,7,3.2,N/A,2.9,TEST HEAVY (1)  Gives good feedback (1)  LECTURE HEAVY (1),16,10/15/2016,CHE120,4.0,3.0,Not Mandatory,Yes,Yes,B+,GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK  TEST HEAVY  LECTURE HEAVY,0,0,I had him for chem 120. It was an easy class but you have to read the text book and make sure you come to class. Most of the test stuff comes from lecture and some from the book. He won\'t throw any irrelevant materials on the exams.

He is very difficult and his grading is very hard. He takes of 5 points for simple mistakes. He is very hard and you have to work extremely hard to get an A. If you are not good with chemistry and need a good grade DO NOT take him because he won\'t make it easy for you.

He is very helpful and there was a lab final that was very similar to the labs we wrote up! Take him to get a good grade :D

Gangian is harder then him and he does not curve. O\'Connor cares about his students and wants us to succeed. If you need to take organic chem take O\'Connor. There are no surprises his sample exam is similar to the actual exam. Study hard and you will succeed

His quizzes were almost give aways compared to the other lab classes. He is helpful to an extent but I suggest you know your stuff before you go into class."

Do problems. Don\'t listen to the horror stories abut orgo. Don\'t even make friends in this class, they will make you paranoid. I can sit down with you and circle every powerpoint slide that was based on an exam question. He is fair."

His notes are really watered down, so that if you depend on his notes alone, you are bound to fail. His lab on the other hand is not bad at all. I will only recommend him for his lab. A ""no"" for his lecture."

Like an orgo class, if you don\'t keep up with this stuff, you\'ll be left out to dry. It\'s not an easy A, but it\'s not impossible either. You just have to put in the time."

His review sheets are not helpful because the real exams are much harder. Half of the student either failed or got D in his class. I would strongly recommend no to take his class. His Labs are stressful than ever.
