Professor Kim was very helpful in class and during office hours, and always explained concepts and problems well. He has an accent sure, but it isn\'t hard to understand, and can be pretty funny at times when he pronounces certain words. I would recommend him to anyone."

This guy is does have an accent, but if you just listen and watch him, and or go to his office hours you\'re good for an A. I missed a lot of classes too... his tests are fair and i actually found calculus fun because of him!"

Kim blends soul deadening tone with a THICK accent, a snooze worthy slurry ""navigating"" you through calculus. As if this jumble wasn\'t bad enough, he gets pissed at you (in the slow-motion action sequence way)if ANYONE asks a question in class.AVOID!!!"
