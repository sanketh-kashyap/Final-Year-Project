She doesn\'t double check details and on occasion this has caused issues with lab experiments; students not having materials, not having access to programs, or not checking if equipment is working or still in the possession of the school. If your work/class schedule cannot change on a moments notice, minimize the # of her classes you take."

Offers little direction and doesn\'t return papers or presentation evaluations in a timely fashion. This 2nd point causes students to be often left unaware that their interpretation of the material is backwards and you\'ll often fail a new assignment BEFORE receiving feedback from prior ones.

Jacobs really knows her stuff and is one of the top teachers I\'ve had in my college career so far. Your GPA may take a hit, but she really helps orgo make sense."

By far one of the best teachers at Rider."

Yes, she knows her material but she does not know how to teach it to the kids in her class. If you would like to take a class where almost everyone fails every exam then take it. This class overtakes your life and your other classes will slack because you will just focus on orgo in order to pass."

The way she teaches this course, it\'s guaranteed to separate the mice from the men. Most people fail the exams, but if you truly understand the content you\'ll do well. She tests you on things you didn\'t necessarily do in lecture, but should be able to figure out on your own."

NOT TRUE! Workshops are on the exam even though they are not mandatory to attend to. Plus what is supposed to boost your grade does not because she ends of failing you for it. Take this class in the summer if you can because it better.

( no curve.. yes, most people did awful ) The final exam - memorize 20 reactions in a week on top of what was already required material for the final exam.

Will not be a pleasant experience, but it is a requirement. I\'d advise taking it in summer unless you really enjoy spending your nights doing chemistry 6 days a week."
