But, he provides an extremely positive learning environment, takes feedback from students, and is clearly a professor who is on the side of his students. The class is hard, but still enjoyable."

His expectations for his students meet or exceed those of the average PhD or MD program. If you\'re looking for an easy Bioscience professor, or a soft class to pad your course schedule, I\'d keep looking. He has high expectations for his students."

Easiest A for me because I actually read the textbook, attended class, and studied. If you don\'t study you wont get a good grade, simple as that."

Yes, you have to read the book for better clarification, because the subjects he teaches are difficult. I had him for Parasitology as well, which was more intense than his Immunology class. Overall, I would recommend his classes because once it is all said and done, I feel confident in that subject."

Test true/false questions are ridiculously difficult- be prepared to study every single slide to do decently in the class (aka I studied an entire week/flashcards/the whole nine yards and only got a B on the test).

He constantly contradicts himself. Complains about teaching at RIT. Be his pet and you\'ll get an A, be a student and you\'ll get a D."

Ended once class with a tirade about how we should all abstain from sex and how his fife had done so so he loved her more for that. Incredibly awkward, tests were ridiculous, avoid if at all possible. Made me hate the class."

The material is interesting,but he expects your test performance to be at graduate school level.I will never take one of his classes again.I suggest you only take this class if you want your GPA to drop."

He expects too much to be remembered for the exams and they are practically impossible. He will run out of time and skip over 15 slides then expect you to know this information on the exam. NEVER TAKE HIM - I cannot stress this enough

(1),14,08/05/2009,MOLEC201,1.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,1,I had him for molecular bio lab and he\'s probably been the worst professor I had at RIT. You cant understand him and he never gives anyone above an 80 on a lab report unless your 4th year and you already know everything. He most likely gave out one A to the entire lab section so if your looking for an A in lab you better be the top student.
