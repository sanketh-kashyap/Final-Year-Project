She does her lessons from a powerpoint which is accessible on the blackboard. She doesn\'t give out too much homework, but she is a harsh grader. She is quite friendly and responds to your emails right away. I would take another class with her."

Some things are just annoying, like all the blackboard assignments when it\'s not an online class.

As long as you do the discussion board you have your paper basically written.
