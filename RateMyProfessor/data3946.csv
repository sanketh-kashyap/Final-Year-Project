Graders grade the write up very harshly. Be meticulous. Write an inconceivable amount about the dullest experiments. Attempt survival.

The class is long and the grade is based entirely on the write up, so hurry through the experiment and do the write up. Don\'t ask stupid questions cause he will male fun of you."

Sometimes you can\'t really understand what he says, but he gives good grades. i got like a 97% avg for each lab! not much effort!"

Everything!"
