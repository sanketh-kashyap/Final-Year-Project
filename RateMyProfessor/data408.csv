She knows a lot about the subject. The class is lots of fun and very straight forward. Her lectures are very nice and organized. Some background in psych is needed before taking this class. Not an easy A, but totally worth it!"

When I received mine back she said ""you did a really nice job I can tell you put forth a lot of effort"" I got an 83. She takes random attendance & wont tell you if youve missed one. So you can never calculate your grade. Dont take the class if youre just trying to get words."

From first few lectures youd assume its an easy class UNTIL THE TEST. Tests are SO applied & you need to have thorough background knowledge of psych prior to the class. Also theres a 20 page paper, RIDICULOUS. You arent allowed to use quotes shes a tough grader.If youre taking this class for words DONT!"

She knows a lot about the subject and applies everything she teaches to her lectures. Her tests are not that easy but they are fair. Very interesting class if you are into education or cognitive psych (or psychology at all). Recommended.

She has 30% grade given based on her mood. if you want to get an A in her class, you must show some slave-like respect to her and the class. Don\'t take this class!"
