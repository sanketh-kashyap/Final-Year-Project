His tests don\'t reflect anything taught in class. I found out late in the semester that I was receiving the same grade in the class as people who were not even doing the readings or showing up.

He gave only two test and a 8 pg paper. He is helpful if you attend class. You really have to keep up with the reading. I won\'t say don\'t take the class, but he isnt the most fun you\'ll have."

He wants you to read his mind and you are never right no matter how hard you try. He was unsympathetic and of no help. Didn\'t help you learn, just expected you to know exactly what he wanted without saying it."

Absolutely terrible, never take! He\'s a quack. Favors select students n likes to give 0\'s to his ""non favorites"" Goes off topic and way into things. Does not make any sense. I recommend finding a new teacher ASAP! Very hard. All semester we only had 3 15 ? quizzes n an 8 pg paper. He is always right in his mind."
