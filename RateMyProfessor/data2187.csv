His tests are kind of difficult, but as long as you use the textbook to study you\'ll be okay. Overall, such a great guy and I would definitely recommend taking him!"

You might find that appealing but when the tests are actually challenging and about things we have never done in class, it gets annoying. To pass you actually have to work on your own and spend a lot of time on the textbook."

He\'s a great teacher in the classroom and a great mentor outside of it. Taken two of his classes and don\'t regret either one.

You have a few papers due the first few days then you go to Daytona/Disney for a week with little to no work. You get to ride along in a stock car going 180 mph, make trips to nascar hall of fame, Richard Petty Museum. If you do what is expected of you, (which is not a lot) you get an A."
