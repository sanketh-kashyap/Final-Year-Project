Test were super easy if you made flash cards and or studied. Gives bonus in class for answering questions. She is hard to understand but if you ask her to repeat she doesnt mind to help out!

However,she will rush you while you are taking them. Her class is extremely boring and attendance is mandatory. She\'s very hard to understand and mutters to herself a lot. I passed her class w/ an A, but it was a very miserable semester bc of her class."
