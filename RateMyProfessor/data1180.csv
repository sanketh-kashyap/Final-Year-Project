The TAs do not really help, Tiamba is the absolute worst. I worked my butt off in this class and did all my work and went to class and still got a B. Papers are so unclear its not even funny.

Hanley is useless and so are the TAs. They offer absolutely no guidelines for completing the papers and won\'t help if you go to office hours. Tests are easy which helps boost grade but the papers were ridiculous. The material is easy but this class is not an easy A and not an easy Gen Ed. Really wish I didn\'t take it.

She is a tough grader. I put a lot of effort into the class and thought my papers were A or B worthy but instead ended up with C\'s. I wouldn\'t say don\'t take this class, but just know it\'s very difficult."

Worst class/professor I have taken since I got to UMASS. Super stressed out attempting to write the essays that has no rubric!Professor does not explain anything at all.

Boring lectures. Interesting material though. You have to want to learn this. Definitely not a good GE. Another professor can utilize the material better. TAs are great though. Especially Manuel.

You\'ll be graded on a rubric for essays that you are not given. It\'s not hard to figure out what you need to include but you are marked off for NOT using what she wants. That would be okay if you could right more than 4 pages. It\'s ridiculous amount of work for a gen ed. Never take it, especially with her."

While yes she has a no phone or laptop usage during her class, she tries to be nice person. Essays are a bit ambiguous on topic but aren\'t super hard. Only 3 essays at 4 pages max. For the exams if you do the readings then you should do fine on them. There\'s 50-75 pgs of reading per week."

Tests aren\'t fair even if you study. Essays are ridiculously ambiguous and she grades you on a rubric she doesn\'t let you see. She also interupts the class a hundred times to tell people to stop texting.. It\'s annoying and disrupts me more than the people texting. Absolutely would not recommend this professor.

Freaked out when we asked to see the rubric she was using to grade us- avoid her- she\'s crazy!

She doesn\'t seem like she knows what she talks about and strays from students questions into asking them what they think about the sociological imagination is without really giving us a definition of it. I understand that we must formulate our own sociological imagination but her prompts have no way for us to show that and no solid rubric

The exams are near impossible. It\'s like she is trying to fool her students. She grades the papers based on a rubric that she doesn\'t give us. Ridiculously challenging for a gen ed low level course. Avoid her at all costs.
