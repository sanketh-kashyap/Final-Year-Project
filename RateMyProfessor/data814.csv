John  Barnes,University of Texas at Austin,Engineering department, Austin, TX,1,3.8,N/A,2.3,,3,01/24/2010,ME335,3.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,ASME test bank! He recycles a lot of his exam problems. This class is not too difficult. He loves to talk about his old football days. He loves to tell jokes during lecture. I\'d say that about 75% of the class skipped class regularly. That should tell you how his lectures go. I\'d advise you to go to lecture and read the book instead of listening to him.
