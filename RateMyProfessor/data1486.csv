Mary Ellen  Seery,University of Dayton,Education department, Dayton, OH,4,1.0,N/A,5.0,,2,06/30/2013,EDT571,1.0,5.0,N/A,Yes,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Completely absurd amount of work expected. Acts like we have nothing else in our life apart from her class. Makes you restate the same information 10 times in 10 different ways. Takes off points for disagreeing with her or having the wrong opinion. She emailed me on a Sunday with 5 new questions and expected me to answer all of them. Awful class.

Almost always an invisible objective she expects you to intuit. Completely unempathetic. Expects all students to be the same, which is ironic given the course material. Worst teacher I have ever had."
