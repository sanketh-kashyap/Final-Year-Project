She went very slow and made sure everyone understood the material. She is ALWAYS available for office hours, which helped a lot. She really wants you to do well, so she replaces your lowest test score with your final and drops a lot of homework grades. Its math, so it is hard. But she made it easier"

Very hard to follow and take notes. She will no do review days before tests. She teaches the concept of the problem once and expects the mastery of the chapter when giving the tests.

I learned more in one day from the book than I did all semester from her. She looks like a misplaced cowboy and is in love with her stupid TI-84 calculator. Class was basically an hour for doing homework. Totally worthless and would only recommend to insomniacs
