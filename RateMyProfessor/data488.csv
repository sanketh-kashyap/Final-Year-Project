Online homework assignments are very long and boring, but only 2 a month.He is really nice and funny, and it is a pleasure to go to his class."

He is a real science professor who can explain concepts clearly and efficiently. Midterm and Final are multiple choice and lectures are downloadable from Blackboard. Very friendly and very approachable. Definitely the professor to have for astronomy."

An excellent teacher - the best science teacher I\'ve ever had - who makes the whole universe accessible to liberal arts students. This is the way science should be taught in a non technical setting! Def. good enough to teach at Harvard, but I\'m glad he doesn\'t. A+++"

He is a great professor and is very approachable. All lectures are downloadable from blackboard and very informative. Midterm and final are multiple choice and highlights basic understanding you should have taken from the course. The course is very interesting and he doesn\'t make it boring. Must Take

He helps out his students alot without making them feel giulty. He is always available to help whether it be email, office hours, or after class. You dont need a text book. ALOT of notes, midterm and final have ALOT of material so you have to study. Gives very helpful review sessions. Just take your notes and youl b go"
