Patrick  Simpson,Collin College,History department, McKinney, TX,3,5.0,N/A,1.3,,3,03/06/2012,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"He was the MOST interesting professor ever! He\'ll make you like history, his lectures are really interesting, has great stories and examples, and he cares for his students. I don\'t remember if he used a textbook, which mean if he asks for one don\'t get it because he\'s not going to use it AT ALL. The assignments he asks for are REALLY easy too!"

I had a hard time studying the right facts for the tests even though they came straight from the notes, so his tests were average, but he is worth it undoubtedly."

You write four doc. analysis\'s-very easy and straight forward. You don\'t need the book. Go to class and take notes- try to stay awake and you will make an A. Tests come straight from the notes. They are not comprehensive exams. He\'s a nice guy,also teaches at the HS level."
