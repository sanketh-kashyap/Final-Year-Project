I like that man very much and i want to take one of his courses. I decided to study in maths after i met him. Why are people criticizing him so harshly???

By far the worst professor I have ever come into contact with. I\'m literally switching my courses around to get away from this guy, and math in general. He killed Calculus 2 for me. I have no idea how he\'s teaching."
