Mitch  Wieland,Boise State University,English department, Boise, ID,0,5.0,N/A,4.0,,1,01/22/2010,ENGL407,5.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Mitch seems very serious and measured in the classroom, which may intimidate those used to extremely casual workshops. Easy to warm up to once you get to know him (and a lot funnier than he seems at first). He\'s very knowledgeable and gets everyone involved, and his manuscript feedback was top notch. Though understated, he is passionate and cares."
