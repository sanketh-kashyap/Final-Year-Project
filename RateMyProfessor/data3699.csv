If you do not understand math very well you will not do well in his class. He is way to smart to teach this class and he can not get down to my level. I do not even ask question because he gets to upset. Do not take this class is you need math to be explained to you.

He may be a smar man but does not understand they we may not know what he is talking about.

He does not finish his sentences before he is on to the next one. Very confusing. This is a last chance teacher. Please if you need a Professor to be clear and ready to help he is not for you. If you all ready know the stuff then you are good to go. He is nice just can not teach if you do not know the math
