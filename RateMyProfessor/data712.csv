Loved his class. Although it sounds scary because your grade mostly rests on the midterm and final paper, it was so much fun! I hated history before his class and he made it so easy to learn and kept me interested with his awesome stories!Def take him if you can!! Truly awesome teacher!"

Very honest, fun, passionate about history. Made us laugh but more importantly made us THINK. Well-dressed! Well-spoken! A shame to see him go, JCCC doesn\'t know what they\'re missing. Nice person, opinionated, a little crazy (as all Ph.D\'s are)! Considered transferring schools to follow him."

He was very helpful and met with us for study groups before the midterm and final. A lot of people did flunk our midterm but he gave people the chance to do extra credit to bring the grades up to b\'s and c\'s. He\'s a pretty cool teacher and will help you out.
