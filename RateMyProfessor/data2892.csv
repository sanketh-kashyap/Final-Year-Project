Margie  Gray,Lake\xe2\x80\x93Sumter State College,Psychology department, Clermont, FL,1,2.1,N/A,4.0,,5,03/17/2010,DEP2004,4.0,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,She is a great teacher. She believes in reading the material and than quizzing on it. She did lectures on each Chapter. I enjoyed her class and wished she taught other classes that I need to take.

Intro to psych is a ""gatekeeping"" class, separates the men from the boys, assignments are ridiculously easy and she freely gave points away. I learned a tremendous amount because I READ THE BOOK, as I was SUPPOSED TO! I missed having lectures, but I was able to learn. This is college, not Jr. High!"

As a matter of fact she doesn\'t teach! She harassed me about a discharge notice after I missed class for 2 days. I was then notified that my grade had gone from a B to an F and there was no way for me to pass. Her teaching style is : Quiz (every day), Teach 10% of material, Quiz, repeat, Test. I do not reccomend!"

She does not spend much time lecturing & has no outline when she does. She barely covers 10% of the textbook. The student is on his own to learn the material. Quizzes & tests seem to be produced by the publisher. Class format is basically read, quiz, test. I would look for a more experienced instructor."
