BJ  Zirger,University of Cincinnati,Business department, Cincinnati, OH,0,1.5,N/A,4.0,,1,02/01/2009,HNRS335,1.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,5,0,There is nothing worse than a professor with an ego. Rather than trying to help students BJ seems to seek out opportunities to tear down students. She demands in class participation but frequently discounts student comments and rudely interrupts when students answer. In addition to this she is simply a tough person to communicate and deal with.
