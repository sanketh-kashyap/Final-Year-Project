She\'s too old and often does not make sense. I attempted going to office hours as well and found her unhelpful. Avoid her if you can as she\'s everything a prof should not be

Her lectures are confusing, there was no formal textbook to help us with very difficult concepts. I learned more about biology & evolution in this class than 1st yr Anthro. TA was hot, but didn\'t help with information b/c he was restricted by prof. Seriously, I taught myself in this course, wiki was my best friend."
