I thought he was a very good teacher, but the tests annoyed me. We spent most classes learning how to do these spreadsheet-type things, but the tests were all these tricky true-false questions."

Repeats the subject if he feels the students are missing a point. The student that commented on Dec 19,10 should have failed the exam, even quoted a wrong course code . He never leaves the class on the contrary he closes the door during lectures to reduce noise, he give us reviews so exam questions are covered"

Yet, his class was extremely boring!!!! Professor loves to repeat same things over and over anain. He may be rude, I think. I saw how he looks at the students that bother him, or walk out the door during the class. His tests are pretty easy, but often you may get across the question that he did not talk about"

Don\'t ask too many questions, he\'ll start to ignore you. He also kinda calls you out in class if you make a mistake, sets you up when he knows it\'s a tricky question you won\'t catch. His tests are easy until the final, then those tricky questions take over."
