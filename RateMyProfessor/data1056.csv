I love the way his class is structured, and how he wasn\'t soley focused on \'communication,\' he wanted us to start to think in a different way. I think the best thing in his class was the slam poem we had to write and present"

I loved his class and will truly miss his teaching styles. I recommend that you take him in the summer cuz its a lot more interesting. And that comment about him favoring little white males is totally bogus.

I encourage anyone to take him. Class not that difficult and he really tries to get everyone to understand him. 3 speeches (2 were automatic A\'s and 3rd you really have to do the work). 5 writting assignments but they were pretty easy. Come to class and even when you do its not that boring. I really recommend him for Comm.

Encourages you to really speak your mind. DO NOT TAKE THE 8am CLASS! stickler for attendance. he picks favorites (young white males). if you\'re not in with him, you will have to try harder."
