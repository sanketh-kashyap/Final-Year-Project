Still, his lectures and notes were clear. The homework and the final exam were difficult. The 2 mid-terms were very easy, and basically the same as the practice exams. The grading was unfair, the final exam was 40% and homework 20%: thats too much!"

Very timid Chinaman. You might not learn much, but if that doesn\'t bother you and you just want an easy A take his class. He gives practice exams and pretty much uses the same questions on the actual exam. Bottom line is he wants people to enjoy statistics, so he\'s very lenient and wants people to get A\'s"

Talks in monotone voice whole class. Smart man, but needs to work on communication skills. Wasted tuition money on this class. Going to resign up under a different professor. Dropped it before the first test."
