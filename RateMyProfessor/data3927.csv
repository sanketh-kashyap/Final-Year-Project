Great sense of humor, and makes you interested in the information. Tests for me were take home and open book, only 3-4 pg paper. Take Lifespan with her! She\'s awesome!"

She is so funny and keeps the whole class entertained throughout the whole 2 hour class. The best part though is that I learned so much while having fun. She cares about how much you learn, not grades. She is super amazing! Take her Lifespan class! Hopefully, she will become a full time Augie teacher."

She\'s wicked funny, but all of her jokes tie into what she is teaching. Her humor helps you b/c you\'re able to remember things better. Tests are sorta hard, but doable. You actually want to go to class bc its fun&she\'s very helpful w/your papers.She\'s probably my favorite teacher ever! Take this class- its wicked awesome!"
