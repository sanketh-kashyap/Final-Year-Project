Comm theory can be sort of tricky because of how abstract it is, but he\'s great at explaining the concepts. The tests are done at home and there are a couple of papers. When it comes to the tests they\'re pretty easy, just time consuming. The papers can be sort of long since they\'re research papers, but he gives good feedback"

He can get a little boring in class, but he at least has personality. Honors version is take-home tests."

There are only 3 tests so the in-class work can really help your grade. There\'s 3 papers, but the first two are 1-2 pages. He constantly reminds you of due dates so it\'s easy to remember when something is due."
