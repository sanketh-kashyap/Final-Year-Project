But you give what you get from her, and you can get A LOT. Would HIGHLY recommend any writer take a class with her. She transformed both my writing and perspective on writing. She\'s given me faith in writers and when I think of my liberal arts education, I will always think of her."

Not too much work. Is initially intimidating, but eventually she gets easier to read. I feel like my writing really improved, largely because of the structure of the workshop."

Her class was tough, but I feel much more capable as a writer than I had ever imagined. Your writing will get wrung out, but the ultimate product is incredible. I wish I could take more classes with her."

She seemed to really love my writing in class, but her grade did not reflect that. There is a huge disparity between her comments and her grading. I wish she had been more clear as to what I was missing to get that A."

Yes, she can be intimidating, but don\'t let it deter you from taking her classes. The topics she explores in nonfiction are fascinating, and she prompts you to write some very interesting things."

Generally if you participate and work hard (turn your work in on time, truly revise, etc), you will learn a lot and earn a decent grade. You may disagree with some of her opinions, but trust her because she is very bright and often right."

I\'m sure she is very smart and educated, but she is not good in a classroom... very supportive, strict when there is no need to be. Won\'t take her again."

The class is an exercise in figuring out what SHE likes, and if you don\'t do (or can\'t figure out) what she wants, your grade will reflect it!\r She plays favorites, and I didn\'t think her ""favorite"" was talented. Disappointing"
