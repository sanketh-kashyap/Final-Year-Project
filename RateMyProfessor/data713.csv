You can tell he feels forced to be there and does not enjoy teaching or care about overall performance of the students in his class. Walks in, rambles for 50 minutes, walks out. Talks in a low, monotone voice and is boring and hard to understand. Answers questions but will make sure you feel scared enough to not ask questions again."

Rambles a lot. Makes everything 100x more confusing than it needs to be. Talks fast but says nothing of value. Speaks unclearly in a monotone voice. It\'s as though he will fall asleep at the drop of a hat. Nice guy but sad to say, worst lecturer I\'ve had."

His lectures are really confusing and all over the place. He is also extremely messy when it comes to writing on the slides. Very monotone, makes me fall asleep every class."
