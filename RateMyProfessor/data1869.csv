Gabriella  Mihalyne,North Seattle College,Nursing department, Seattle, WA,2,1.5,N/A,5.0,,2,09/01/2011,NURS099,1.0,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"This class was a joke. I thought it was a critical thinking course related to nursing, we ended up writing a lot and editing papers. Our group spoke with the head of nursing at the time to petition this class be taken off the requirement for entrance into the program. Waste of time and money, must say def a difficult for a 2credit class."

For a 2-credit course, the amount of work is insultingly heavy. Her directions are unclear and messy."
