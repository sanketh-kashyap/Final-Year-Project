Anthea is very sharp intellectually and also very nice. If you pay attention and keep up with the class you will learn a lot. You will enjoy it too. She helped me be a better critical thinker which I now see is very important in writing.

No passion, quiet. Nice person. MANDATORY attendance. Leave 10 minutes earlier? She\'ll make sure she deducts that for points. Useless class- didn\'t learn a thing. I want a refund!"
