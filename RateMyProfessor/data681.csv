She was tough but very good. She made sure that you walked out of her class at the end of the semester knowing most of what she taught. Thumbs up!

The amount of reading and writing required is more appropriate for a 300-level class. However, if you are interested in the subject matter, you will walk away with a wealth of information. Just keep up with the reading!"
