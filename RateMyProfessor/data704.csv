Got an A in the class, even though I fell asleep most of his boring lectures. Make sure to bring an iclicker for this class, since it is 10% of your grade. I tried talking to him after class, but he seemed annoyed. After, that I stopped approaching him. If you want an easy A, it\'d be a great class for you."

The questions on tests come from his lectures. It feels like bulimic studying, but if you went to all with him, you could get much more out of the class."

His lectures were boring, talked about things I already knew... When I asked him a question, he just kind of brushed me off and I was like okay. I guess I asked you a stupid question. Thanks for the humiliation prof. If you can handle a boringrude professor, y\'all should take this class."

Your lowest midterm is dropped which is nice, but the tests do not reflect what is taught in lectures. It is not hard to pass the class per se, but you would have to read the textbook thoroughly to get an A."

Easily one of the most failed undergrad science courses. Take another class if you\'re looking for a easy science credit, this is not the class for that."

He pretty much just read his website word for word at a pretty slow speed. Has you do a project which was fairly easy. He is a good choice if you want a very easy professor. If you want to learn astronomy go rent a science channel documentary and save your money.

Prof. Brau is really clear on his points, especially if you need help with certain concepts. His tests are based on mostly lecture notes, but he does make sure you do the reading by placing specific reading questions on the test. Excellent guy overall."

Never opened Textbook once. Attendance is not mandatory but if you just go to class and pay attention just a little you\'ll be fine. test questions are often verbatim from notes and lectures (which are all online). He even puts together a review page online before every test that proved very helpful. i recommend this class.

Prof isn\'t easy to work with and doesn\'t explain the material very well. Be prepared to fall asleep in class and read the text outside of class. Print lecture notes before class cause there\'s not time to take notes. Exams are mostly off of lecture notes.
