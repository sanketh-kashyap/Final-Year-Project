Overall even though he is generous. He is very bad at explaining to students. He doesnt like you if you ask too many questions. He gets upset if you do. He is nice person but not enough for a student to pass his class. He only gives midterm and final exam. If you fail in one of them. You failed the whole class.

Stuff that comes simple to him, he assumes should come simple to you."
