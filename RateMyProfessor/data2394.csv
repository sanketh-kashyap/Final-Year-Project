I loved her as a teacher, she\'s done a lot of different things in the science community so she knows a lot of different things about science in general. She was awesome and had a personal connection with most students."

You really only need the text book if you missed a class or if you\'re having a hard time understanding a concept. There are only a few assignments and the tests are straight forward. Just show up and do the work.

Does a great job of explaining things. I highly suggest her."

She gives you a review packet that covers everything that will be on the Exams usually a week or two before.

She was a pleasure to have this semester. I just wished I had done better in her class than I did, but that blizzard week really threw me off. Oh well, I can\'t fight with Mother Nature. Other than that, try her out, you will love her."

Moves too quickly, the book used for the class is AWFUL they say that they created it to make it easier when it just hinders you learning. She goes WAY too quickly, people in my LAB class agreed and said they had stopped going to her class because they werent learning anything. It is hard to pay attention to her."

She explains everything clearly,and moves at your pace. She offers help after her classes, and includes eye catching pictures and examples in her powerpoints. If you haven\'t taken Bio-101 yet, take her! She\'s the best."

Goes into great detail for difficult topics. Adds extra cool things during lecture to keep you as interested and amazed about the subject of biology as she is. She is wonderful.
