Only counts the best 5/10 quizzes towards your grade and offers extra credit. She doesn\'t work through problems or offer help, she tells you to ask a neighbor but sucks if they don\'t understand either. She did write the entire class a letter of rec though, so she is super caring!"

There is only a midterm and a final. Her explanations are very well detailed and full explained. If I could have her again as my professor I would without a doubt."

I hope that she will teach other Math classes that I need to take. She is really there for her students and you can tell that she likes teaching. Also, a very good teacher if you are a visual learner."

This is my 3rd year and she is probably my favorite professor at csueb. I\'m not the brightest in math but she really made it easy to understand and is so interested in helping her students without a doubt. She was so kind to bring snacks during some classes. Its hard to find profs at eb that is willing as her

Lectures can be dry- but it IS statistics after all. Assigns A LOT of homework, but you can chose your questions. Allows ANY notes and handouts on midterms/finals. She even brings us snacks since the class runs from 6:30 until 8:20- when most of us would be eating dinner. Wonderfully nice woman, would take again."

That\'s a bonus!
