I was absent over 15 times, and got an A. Just do the assignments she gives (which are so easy a little kid can do) and you should have no trouble passing. By taking nalbandyants, expect to instantly pass. I guarantee. I admit she does not teach too well but alot of the material is interesting."

It seems as if she prepares a lesson at random. She is not organized and students won\'t ever learn anything from her. Don\'t take her if this is your major."

Her class is all based on people\'s opinions. There is no science or fact behind her study. I think it was a bit waste of my time, I have learned nothing. She does try to make people participate and get involved. It\'s an easy class, you just won\'t learn much."
