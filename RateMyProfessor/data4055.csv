Does a horrible job explaining concepts, can\'t stay on topic, and leaves a lot of material for the student to learn on their own. Find another CHM professor unless you are fine with learning all the material on your own. Also, some CHM is a prereq thus no reason to complain about that."

She really is wonderful, and is very helpful. She does tend to jump around a bit from subject to subject, and moves pretty fast but she really doesn\'t deserve the rating she has. There is very little work outside of class, and labs suck but they always do."

She does jump from subject to subject, but honestly she is not a horrible teacher at all. If you pay attention in her class and don\'t confuse YOURSELF, you will be okay. I feel that the only reason people did so horrible in my class is because they asked useless questions."

I am an A/B student with a 4 year degree and had recently taken 131 but I dropped the class because I was frustrated beyond belief.

Doesn\'t know how to explain concepts well, writes practice problems on the board, SHE quickly does the problem and expects you to know what she did. Doesn\'t spend enough time on topics...She rushes through everything!"

I worked way harder than I should have had to to get my grade. She seemed to jump from subject to subject and nothing was explained fully. The tests were much harder than the homework/quizzes, but she graded them pretty easy. Overall, very nice, but definitely find a different teacher."

She does not teach clearly, and is very disorganized. She is one of the nicest teachers I have had at Wake Tech, but not one of the best teachers. I would highly suggest finding a new chem teacher."

The problem she has is staying on task. She goes on random tangents that are neat historically, but are not subject matter related, and often contradict what you are supposed to learn. She also has a hard time communicating the subject matter, in a way which is easy to understand."

She really wants to help you, however the presentation comes across as very confusing. I found the order that we covered concepts was seemingly backwards... learning bonding before atomic structure etc. You\'ll have to teach yourself from the book... which is dense. Test material doesn\'t match hw."

She is indeed not the best professor, and she does make many mistakes, would recommend taking Metzger for 151, also just a side note, if you have not taken a refresher course on chem YOU WILL FAIL."

She makes mistakes regularly in class but then grades her students\' homework/quizzes/tests harshly. She gets frazzled and does not explain things in a clear simple manner.

She makes many mistakes when writing out examples to the class (almost on a daily basis), but keep in mind she is dyslexic, so that is not a point to criticize her teaching skills of. Would not recommend her at all...her class averages on tests are pretty low."
