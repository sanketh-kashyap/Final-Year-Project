TOUGH GRADER  GET READY TO READ,2,0,I had Dr. Bakkegard for BIOL 105 and had to withdraw after the first test. She basically sets you up to fail. Anytime I asked for help she just told me to go to tutoring. Unless you are amazing at biology do not take her. Friends in the same class with a different professor are doing well. Take another professor. Do not recommend at all.
