She is all over the place and will go off about things that make no sense and are completely irrelevant. She lost me sat least 20 times a class, and that was only if she actually showed up. Don\'t take her class."

Rosenberg\'s style is boring and complicated. Math 120 is the easiest class you will ever take... But you won\'t be challenged, and for good students, that will drive you crazy!"
