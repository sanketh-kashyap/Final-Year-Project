Allan  Cooper,California Polytechnic State University,Architecture department, San Luis Obispo, CA,0,3.5,N/A,2.0,,1,02/10/2009,ARCH352,3.5,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Cooper is legit. If you are looking for a studio challenging enough but you still can have a social life, cooper is for you. He is kinda crazy but he\'s super chill. Probably won\'t learn a ton in this class but it\'s fun."
