This was my 3rd time taking psych and she really made it intersting. Made B\'s on all her tests but I attended all her classes and she gave me an A! As long as you try and show you deserve an A she will make sure you get it!

She allows for extra credit and grades very easy. My only complaint was following through with a few things. But she was very understanding and taught you a lot and I enjoyed her class!
