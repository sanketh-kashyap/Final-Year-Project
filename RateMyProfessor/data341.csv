People complaining about him are simply bad students. If you try and work hard it will pay off with him. Can\'t give enough praise."

His teaching methods were different, teaches you shortcuts... in the end turned out to be beneficial. Tough grader, no half credit on exams, most half credit he\'ll give you is for 2 q\'s... students didnt ask questions, he would put them on the spot, he eventually eases up as long as he see\'s u trying & asking q\'s."

The testHW do not count instead he uses them to gauge how the class is doing. During class he encourages questions. He tends to teach shortcuts which makes the class confusing. Most of us are there not knowing the basic formula for solving equations. Also he is moody.
