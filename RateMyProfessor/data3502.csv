If you pay attention though and participate in class it isn\'t that hard. She will comment on the fact that no one is talking and that makes everything a little more awkward so participation helps. She is somewhat a tough grader and is very specific on papers.

Mostly an easy grader, but gets a little tougher at the end. The class is very boring and sometimes pointless, so it doesn\'t matter if you skip sometimes. As long as you turn in the 3-4 papers (which aren\'t that long) & take the 1 test you should be fine. She\'s not great but not that bad either."

It has nearly nothing to do with expository writing, I would actually say that it is closer to an art appreciation class. You write a couple papers but the majority of those papers and in class writings have to do with critiquing art. She loves the subject but it\'s boring."

It is definitely worthless. She does not know how to teach. She lacks enthusiasm and interpersonal skills with students. Her lectures shows lack of preparedness and copies things on the book verbatim. I only felt sorry for her because she is partially deaf, which would not matter if she would show some sign of humanity."
