He assigns a TON of reading & calls on everyone frequently, so you have to do all the reading. He leans right politically, which shows, and he favored the more conservative students. This is a project class, and he gave average grades with good comments- I got an 8/10; only comment was ""Great Job!"" Class not worth the work"

This class is hard material and is tough for the average law student. Grades tough and the test is time pressured. Good teacher and very willing to help after class. You will learn a lot and do fine in the class if you take good notes and study well.
