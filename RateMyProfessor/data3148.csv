Ashworth was too softspoken and talked too fast, sometimes it seemed like she didn\'t know the material. tests sucked, read the book. extra credit offered in lecture."

If you don\'t read the book, it\'s your own fault. Quizzes and tests are not terribly difficult, but they are not easy either. Dr. Ashworth does read from her slides, but if you read the material beforehand, you will know what\'s going on. She is very nice, and is concerned about her students."

She reads off the slides; she doesn\'t even teach. it\'s a tragedy for students who actually want to learn. She is sweet, but that doesn\'t hold up in a college course."

She lets other professors teach 90% of the class. She reads off slides and goes way to fast for the lectures she does do. Quizzes have some questions with tiny details from the book or lecture with very little importance... One word describes this class, ""Random"""

When she lectured she just read verbatim off of slides. Probably a nice lady, but has no idea how to teach."

Overall, the class is somewhat challenging. Lectures are mostly taught by other prof. in the bio/biochem department. Exams and quizzes are not that bad and do not reflect the in-depth detail of the lecture/textbook material which is nice."
