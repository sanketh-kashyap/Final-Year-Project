Uses rubrics but she liked papers that didn\'t follow the rubric more. Seemed to have a hard time remembering what she tells the class regarding assignments, changes mid class."

You read a lot, write one response to reading per week which isn\'t that bad! The quizzes are easy if you do the reading it is common sense. Great discussions in class when people actually participate, which for her is kind of a requirement. I would take her again if needed."

She is one of my favorite teachers. She\'s young and has personality. You MUST read the book (no sparknotes), and go to class because she gives quizzes which aren\'t hard. The writing isn\'t that bad. And the books are interesting. TAKE HER!!"

When you go to conferences with her make sure you ask what you need to do to get an A on the paper, because otherwise she will say she loves it and tehn give you a C."
