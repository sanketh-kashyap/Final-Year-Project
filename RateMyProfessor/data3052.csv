He makes learning self-defense fun and not intimidating. It was worth taking it as an 8am. You will have to have a partner in the class kind of make it an easy way to meet people. Show up and participate. As long as you try he will pass. He also is kind of funny.

He showed you multiple times how to do the releases and there were only 3 skills tests & 3 online tests throughout the semester. No final. If you show up and put any effort into your skills tests, you\'ll get 100s. Would definitely take him again. Wish there was a 2nd year class!!"
