Even though this is a 100 level class she gives a workload for a graduate class. DO NOT TAKE unless you\'re really into AMST.

Her work load is no joke at all... You have to read ALL (5-6 readings) in first of every week. I wish she can break up the readings into separate days in consideration for students who has job(s)."

If you do not have an electronic device to read the documents in class, you will spend lots of $$ on paper.I recommend this class for students who are truly interested in American studies. Not an easy class. Professor is nice"

Unfortunately it does not feel ""welcomed,"" rather it seems it need to be hers or you lose points regardless of your effort. Not satisfied. Other AMST courses where great at UMass."

Overall, the subject was thought provoking, and you walk away feeling like you learned something valuable"

It is lots of reading and writing. She is very strict with attendance and participation as well.She does listen to all opinions and keeps a respectful tone. The class is though but it comes in handy later when you are working on other research papers. She also teaches effective reading and note taking. Worth the hard work.

Although the course content is amazing, the course is simply too much work. Negron cant even keep up with the amount she assigns."

Gives 4 major assignments that are not easy to say the least. Shes extremely wordy and likes to talk really fast. This being said the class is extremely interesting and important to history.

Do not give your own opinion in her class, it isn\'t welcomed if it\'s not a regurgitated version of her opinion on the issues. If you\'re looking to take a course that will be enlightening, go see another professor."
