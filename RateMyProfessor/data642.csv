Meet with her in her office and she makes sure you understand everything. Doesn\'t waste time with the confusing text in the book. Just tells you how it is and skips the BS.

Not only does she help prep you for the huge citation exam at the end of each semester, she prepares you to the fullest for the stupid huge legal writing final. She walks you through everything necessary for papers, etc. Great professor, pray you get her."

She is willing to help, but not give you the answer. I have learned so much from her class. If you go to class and pay attention (don\'t need to read) and actually try... then you will do well. I don\'t know what the person below is talking about, she is fair. Very good professor."

Sarcastic and insulting to my classmate. Give grades on kissing up curve. lies to class about their chances. IF she likes a guy, she will send him flirty emails. She talks trash about students to students. School should man up and can her. She could be a good teacher if she wanted, but she doesnt want. You will think wour doing wel"

She didn\'t give us any direction then yelled at us for not doing what she wanted! Watch out in LP2, the curve may knock you down a grade! She is a real nice lady, always available to help and answer questions."

She really doesn\'t explain what she wants nor does she give examples. She may be something to look at but she is rather lacking in regards to her teaching. I\'d recommend switching to another LP class.

Wants you to learn and will do a lot to make that happen. The class it self isn\'t tough as long as you do what is asked of you.
