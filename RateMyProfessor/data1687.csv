We only did an essay every unit. It really wasn\'\'t that much work compared to other professors. I focused more on the content of my essays but she\'\'ll take off points for things such as not using the word that. She edits your rough draft for you. This wasn\'\'t a stressful class. You\'\'ll make an A if you simply read.

She made exceptions for me when I was out of town and worked with me on getting things turned in. She has five major papers that she grades very fairly, she lets you turn them in twice to get the best grade possible. A lot of reading in her class, a quiz everyday. So do not skip the readings!"

If you get on her ""good"" side and laugh at her jokes during the beginning, you\'ll be set for the rest of the semester. Essays are EASY. You write a rough draft, turn it in, she tells you what to fix, then you get a 100 on the final draft if you do what she says. Would definitely recommend her for an easy A."
