You\'ll learn nothing in her class. You\'ll do all the work and feel like you didn\'t need a teacher. Strongly not recommended"

She is not hard at all, midterm and final plus short group presentation. She comes to class with her hand bag and nothing else, plus she is always twenty minutes late. Not organized, and doesn\'t care to be. easy grader, def recommend her class, just don\'t expect to learn anything."

She had one pet who she dedicated all of her time and attention to, no one else mattered. It is a very difficult subject and she was not at all helpful. She canceled class about 5 times throughout the semester, though I think she might have been pregnant. We were notified that same morning by email"
