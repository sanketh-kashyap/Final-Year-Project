Knows every student by name by the second week. Midterms and exams are really hard, and if you zone out for a second in class you can get lost, but he\'s very approachable and is always willing to help. Do the work and you\'ll do alright in his class"

Tutorials were SO SO helpful he would guide any answer in Mastering Physics. Doesn\'t mind staying a bit late to help. If you put in the work he\'ll notice and take it into consideration. Exams were hard.

Tends to solve problems for himself rather then showing the class how to solve it."

His tests are tough, especially the multiple choice, but you can do well if you try. Don\'t talk in his class. Great guy overall, and not a bad guitar player either."

He will go the extra mile to help a student, as long as the student is willing to accept help from him. Great personality, and great at motivating people. He\'s a gem."

I almost dropped out, but he encouraged me enough throughout the year that I decided to tough it out. Can be hard to hear and understand at times, but he is great 1 on 1. The tutorials are NOT time off. Go to them, he is good at helping with problems and walking you through step by step. Despite struggling with course, great prof."

But still go to class as this will affect his willingness to help you. He is a nice prof, and makes an effort to learn all the students names. Do the practice problems, as the tests are only solving (sometimes weird) questions."

He is easily angered by people talking in class but otherwise he is cheery and nice. One-on-one he is amazing and can make you understand anything, just not in the classroom. If there is 30 seconds left in class, he will use them."

He is super smart and very helpful. He wants students to learn and do well so he does what he can to make this possible. Easy marker on assignments, exams were hard but open book."

He is sometimes a little hard to understand, but he is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Obviously if you have made it to third year physics at stfx you know to show up to class, so do that"
