Adam  Chodorow,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,7,3.9,N/A,4.0,TEST HEAVY (1)  Get ready to read (1)  Participation matters (1),4,06/17/2016,LAW654,4.0,4.0,Mandatory,Yes,Yes,B,GET READY TO READ  TEST HEAVY  PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,"Prof. Chodorow was a great teacher. Its a typical law class with heavy reading (20-45 pages per class), lecture (no power point and bad handwriting), and cold calls (but accepts volunteers in lieu of getting cold called. He has a great handle on the material and conveys it quite well. If you want to take Bus. Orgs. take it with Chodorow."

Chodorow is clear and enthusiastic about what he teaches. I thought the final was pretty fair (leaning on easy). Be warned that the people in the class the year before me said the final was awful... Maybe he dumbed it down a little."

Tax is hard. If you need help, he gives it to you. If you have a question, he\'ll answer it. If you stay up on his homework assignments and reading, it makes more sense. The class itself is difficult, but he is a great professor and very helpful."

The amount of work is so great that you honestly do not have time to manage your other classes. You also cannot fall behind because you will not be able to catch back up. I don\'t recommend this class.
