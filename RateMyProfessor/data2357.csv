Her classes are always interesting, and filled with a lot of interaction. Her tests can be incredibly difficult, but they really stretch you to think in a way not many other professors I\'ve had do. The group work is a pain, but it\'s a necessary evil. Reading ahead is advised, but not required."

Test format was something I never seen before, 50 matching with double the choices. She wasn\'t helpful and lacked knowledge about certain topics she deemed important. Class is not worth taking. Take this introduction class somewhere else."
