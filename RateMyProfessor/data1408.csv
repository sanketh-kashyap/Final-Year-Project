She does not care for her students. Quiz grade averages have been insanely low. Hard grader. She only comes to discussion for the money only. She needs to go away!

She totally sucks at multiplying. She does not correct you, she lets the class as a whole correct you. Homework is online on Wiley Plus,(Don\'t buy the book). As for now, class seems to be going good though. I really think she has like a lazy eye or something."

She tries to be helpful, but I think she is unorganized and kind of an airhead. Be prepared for a lot of ridiculousness in her class."
