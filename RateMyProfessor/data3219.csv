He\'s actually very funny if you can pay attention and he\'s very intelligent on the subject. He\'s probably the nicest professor I\'ve taken.

He lets you know what he wants up front, and is pretty amiable. I haven\'t ever seen him upset or angry."

You\'ll have to listen to him talk for a long time about kind of boring topics, but he likes showing videos and stuff so it\'s not terrible. A pretty easy grader, too."

His lectures can seem unorganized and unclear, but if you do the reading before hand, they make more sense. Also, he is very down to earth, so ask him questions! Shober is also hilarious! He grades fairly."

His lectures are kind of rambling, but if he\'s about to tell you something that you need to know for a test, he\'ll tell you. He\'s a surprisingly picky grader, but if you go to see him during office hours, he is fantastically helpful. The Shober you see in class is just the tip of an iceberg."
