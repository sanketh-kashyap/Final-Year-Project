Milton  Schroeder,Arizona State University,Law department, Tempe, AZ,1,3.2,N/A,3.3,,3,03/30/2010,LAW515,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"I had Professor Schroeder last year for contracts and really liked him. He is very kind, and is the rare breed of law professor who is incredibly knowledgeable and can impart that knowledge without being a jerk. I\'m taking an upper level class with him this semester, and I think he\'s even more clear and methodical teaching the higher level stuff."

I\'m sure he\'s a nice enough guy but avoid having him for contracts if at all possible.
