I had her in the winter and had some trouble with the material. After I started going to office hours I went from an F to a B in 5 weeks. Really approachable great with 1 on 1 always willing to make time

Very helpful, flexible office hours. Optional homework, but test questions are straight from the homework/workshops. Very open to questions. Explains the theory, does many examples and actually lets you work them out."

She is very helpful in class and in office hours. She doesn\'t collect the homework but she offers extra credit to anyone that does hand it in. The tests are based off of the homework and workshops so it is important that you do both. Take her if you can!

Test are easy if you go over her material. A lot of opportunity to increase your grade. She is nice and always available to help you with questions. Strongly recommend for calculus for science management class.

I failed the first exam but then she gave so much extra credit that I somehow got an A without taking the final (Final will replace lowest grade). Very friendly teacher and very helpful. Only downside is the textbook was extremely expensive.

The material is dry, but she makes it clear for you to understand. She\'s also very available to talk to you about any questions. She will put in that extra effort to help you understand."
