Nothing is ever good enough for this guy and he comes off as very rude in comments he leaves on your work. At least 40-50 pages of reading per week in addition to required film viewings and audio, as well as discussions which are never good enough either. Do not recommend this course."

This professor bored me to tears. Unfortunately I couldn\'t drop it because I added it last second, but it was very lecture heavy with no powerpoints. It was the professor sitting and talking at us for most of the class. Do Not Take!"

Overall, the class was easy and interesting, but the feedback he gives on papers comes off as rude and not very constructive. I\'m a trained writer, and the comments he was giving were superfluous and largely unwarranted. To be honey, I was offended at the feedback given on both papers because of the tone he used."

He assigns 3-5 chapter readings a week and is clear on how he wants the journals to be but nothing ever satisfies him. When I realized I clearly wasn\'t giving him what he wanted I emailed him for extra help and he was rude and dismissive. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!

Amazing class - so interesting. Brought clarity and deeper understanding of the Beatles creative process and how they were truly an artform onto themselves. Enlightening course!

I have so much respect for him and his intellect. He makes everyone\'s opinion seem relevant and important. The workload in a Kimsey class is usually large, but the content is deeply interesting and engaging. His classes will blow you away and cover so many perspectives in the process. Kimsey for President."

He speaks softly and his mellowness definitely turns some people off, but he\'s 100% tuned in, on the ball, and brilliant. The low-key style is a facade that he uses to make some very heavy learning go down easy. Best of breed, I\'ve taken 3 or 4 of his classes. Lots of reading, but it\'s an absolute honor to be his student."
