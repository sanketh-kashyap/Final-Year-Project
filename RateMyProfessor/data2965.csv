He did try to make it more exciting by adding a few ""fun"" assignments. He was really great at giving feedback and my writing style and content really improved because of it. He\'s a bit of a chatter-box and can get off topic, but overall he explains content well."

Attendance is taken every day, so you need to be there or ur grade will be dropped. The teacher is a nice guy and is always available to help you. The class is hard, but if you want to get better at writing, that\'s just what you have to do."
