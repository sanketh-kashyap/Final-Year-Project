Big tests 150+ pt each. Medical diagrams are hard, she wont tell you which to study. Extra credit is summaries of medical stuff. HW is each week + due 2 days before class. Friendly and caring but very hard teacher. Class always goes over regular class time extra 20-10mins+"

YOU WON\'T PASS.  GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK  GET READY TO READ,0,0,This was my first health class and I was very scared before the term even started. First day she told us we would go over the entire textbook; she was not kidding. IT IS CRUCIAL TO READ EACH LESSON & DO THE EXCERSISES at the end of each chapter! She doesn\'t grade them but they help a lot. Each day & test is different so don\'t get too comfortable!!!

Her stories made our long class fly by. Thre is a quiz or test every class, but this keeps you on top of your homework. You will need to study in order to succeed. She offers a lot of extra credit, and it amazes me how few choose to do it."

YOU WON\'T PASS.,0,1,"She sometimes gives extra credit just for showing up to class on time. This class was far too easy because of all the extra credit. Her teaching style changes daily depending on her mood, and she will make a spectacle if she catches students checking their cell phone, or even yawning too much. Also, she pronounces many of the terms wrong."
