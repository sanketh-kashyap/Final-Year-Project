He is not helpful, the student must learn a new subject entirely on their relying on a confusing book based on a confusing subject. I do not recommend him whatsoever. Avoid him at all costs!!!!"

I didn\'t think it was that hard, but there is a lot of reading which is expected from an online class. I felt that the quizzes and test were straight forward and he was quick about answering questions on the discussion board.Overall, not hard as long as you buckle down on the reading."
