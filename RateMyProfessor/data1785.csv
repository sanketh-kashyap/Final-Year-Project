She takes off points for the tiniest things."

She rounds your grades DOWN by not giving half grades (say you deserved a B+, she gives you a B). Which brings your overall grade down. Overall: nice person, but she has a VERY UNFAIR grading system and exams."

She is very straightforward and only tests on things she said in class. There is a midterm, 2 papers, and a final. She tells you exactly which pieces will be on tests, but to do well you have to go to class and take good notes. She is an excellent professor, I would love to take her again."
