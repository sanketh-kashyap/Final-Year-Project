Genuinely cares that you grasp the concepts. Is very accessible to students and always willing to take extra time to explain things. Not an easy class...you will have to work hard for your grade. What seem to be straight forward concepts are at times twisted into obtuse exam questions. Go review your test after exams. It will help
