She is a hard teacher, but I learned so much in her class. For me, she was always there to help me with my papers and homework assignments. I learned so much in her class and recommend anyone to take this class who is up for a challenge."

Does not give constructive feedback. Very stressful class. She thinks students don\'t have other classes to take. Piles on large amounts of HW! Take Vlaicu or Chong.
