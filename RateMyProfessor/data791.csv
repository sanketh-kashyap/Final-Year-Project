He will only give you ranges of where you should be; therefore, if you\'re one of those people who need an A in this class, you\'re gambling a bit since he doesn\'t tell you the curve of the exams until after the final."

The teacher is very knowledgeable and informative, but students intelligence falls all across the spectrum. This makes for mostly retarded ethics discussions, but once in a while, there are coherent, intelligent exchanges that take place."

There are class quizzes but just read the assign scientific paper"
