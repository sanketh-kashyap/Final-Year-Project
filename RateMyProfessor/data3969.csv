I took this mans class once, and from his unclear speech I could tell that he was inexperienced. I couldnt even understand what he was saying because of his thick accent. THIS MAN NEEDS SOME MILK!! I wanted to major in Aerospace Engineering and I thought this class would help, but it felt like a waste of time for me. So overall, he sucks!!!!"
