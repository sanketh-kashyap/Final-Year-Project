I felt that the teacher was not helpful and at times came across as very rude. He sat in his office the whole semester except when he was doing his few tutorials.

The class itself can be frustrating but he\'s a good teacher that helps as much as he can.

He didn\'t offer much help while in class. He basically instructed for 3 days and then sat in his office for the rest of the semester and didn\'t come out. He shows signs of being biased against graphic design students as well as opposed to studio majors.
