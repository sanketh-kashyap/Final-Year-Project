After I had straight classes from 8am she kept me interested with her inhuman amount of positive energy. Accounting is a VERY dry course but she keeps it interesting and motivating. Sign up for her class before it fills up!!!

She is very fair, friendly, & helpful. Pay attention, show up for class, do the homework to make sure you understand concepts. If you don\'t understand something, ask her...she will go over material again to make sure you understand. Took her for ACCT 2301 also. Great classes!"

Don\'t expect to go in and make an easy grade you have to work for it but she helps you along the way. Read the book and do the self examination questions and make sure you go over the quizzes online. Great class and teacher!!

She made acct. seem easy, She goes over the information very well to where you will understand it. The quiz she gives you, comes straight off line, word for word. And the test are from problems out of the book or homework. Awesome professor!"
