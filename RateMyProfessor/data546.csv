She is easily the worst teacher I have had at any level. My exit evaluation of Florida State\'s MAcc program will reflect my opinion of her, since she teaches 3 of my core classes. Seriously consider Audit, Corporate or AIS track to avoid this professor. THE WORST."

Her exams are the hardest/longest & most students cannot finish. Unless you go to class everyday & write down every word/example she says & gives you, you will not get an A. She\'s Impossible!!"

Graduated summa ****laude and found it impossible to get an A in her class. Avergage for the final was a 58..nobody finished and provided little to no curve. AVOID THIS MONSTER!!!

It is not hopeless, however, and by reading the text closely and doing practice problems from the book it IS possible to get an A. Dr. A was very responsive to emails but turnaround on graded assignments was a little slow."

You must work very quickly on exams (many students ran out of time to finish the exam). Multiple choice questions are fair, but the workable test problems are intense. The average on the 1st exam was a 67%; the 2nd test 71%; She does curve though. Very nice person, but this class is a bit overwhelming."

She couldn\'t even give a straight answer to how many questions are on the test, if we need to know dates for the test, and the best way to study for the test. In a nutshell, ATWOOD SUCKS!!!!!"
