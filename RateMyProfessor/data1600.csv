Some of the papers require a bit, but start them right away, she gives you 2-3 weeks usually. She also understands when you need to miss class for an emergency. I was in a wreck on the way to class and she didn\'t count it as an unexcused absence. Easy A if you actually do the papers."

Get to know her, she\'s a hoot and she really loves her students. She\'s very honest and makes the class interesting. Little assignments that are just a few sentence responses throughout the year and a long paper that you present, but it\'s easy. She\'s amazing, seriously going to miss her a lot. Show up though!"

She assigns due dates for all papers but they are merely suggestions. You turn in a lot of drafts but they don\'t count for a grade. The feedback she gives does help a lot! She emails back quickly and her office hours are great. Required conferences are a big help!
