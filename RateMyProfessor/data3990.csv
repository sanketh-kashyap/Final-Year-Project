He can be long winded but he means well. He truly creates an environment which allows one to grow as an artist. I highly recommend him.

Due dates are the worst because everyone pins up their work (this is the nice part) and then as a class you talk about each piece. That\'s the worst because he expects to spend a minimum of 10 minutes on each person\'s work and in a class of 25, this was torture. Would not take"

He is a great artist, passionate about art. He use to teach at Otis. He\'s not the type of teacher that does demos or shows you how to draw, but he gives you feedbacks and what you should do."

He was genuinely passionate about art and was great about critiquing. He works with you on your level, with me, he pushed me really hard because I was a little more advanced and my portfolio is now awesome because of it. The art center was thoroughly impressed with the work I created in his class under his guidance."
