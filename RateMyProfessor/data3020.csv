Kevin  McMahon,NHTI,Criminal Justice department, Concord\'s Community College, Concord,4,3.5,N/A,4.4,,5,11/29/2013,CH120,5.0,5.0,Mandatory,N/A,N/A,A,,2,0,"The class was extremely difficult, but he was always willing to give extra help. I took it as a night class and he would stay as late at 11:30 to help students who were struggling. We had so much fun though that sometimes we stayed late even if we weren\'t having difficulties. He is a great professor!"

He is thorough to the core and is an intense teacher who does not accept sloppy work. You will need to STUDY for his class, but will have a great understanding of the material afterwards. I enjoyed his class, teaching style and dedication. Highly recommended for anyone in CJ"

He is a little to intense and just needs to chill out.

Intro to Forensics incorporates several areas of science, as stated in the course description. For one to take this class without any background in any of the sciences, I can understand how they might greatly struggle. All science classes require study, this one is no different. ""Intro"" does not mean ""easy."""

Dose not accept any thing but 1000%. You have to memorize the book, to pass with a ""C"" or ""B"". One woman had a 4 GPA and it brought her down to 3.4! He is very good at forensic science but, needs to take some teaching, and communication classes."
