He has a bigger heart as far as grading concern. he is offering a lots of extra credits. This is my first semester in UB and getting A from this class boost by inspiration is large university. I highly recommended this professor.

Dr. Ahsan tries his best to help his students understand the matierals given. His notes are highlights and key points from the textbook. He truly does care about his students and encourages them to visit his office hours. I hate chemistry but Dr. Ahsan made it interesting and fair to learn

He gives random bonus points so go to class and pay attention, sometimes he will ask you to turn in a problem on the board for bonus points. His tests are hard because there is so much material on them."

He makes it interesting and explains it well, and his exams are the fairest exams I\'ve ever seen. They are very similar to the practice exams and homework problems.

He has the best understanding of organic chem BY FAR when compared to the rest of UB\'s crew. He also projects his understanding so that it\'s actually EASY TO COMPREHEND!

He flies through material. the final you NEED to know at least 80-100 reactions (no joke). stay as far away as possible. i have a B+/A- going in and i hope to come out alive on this final

He expects you to memorize 200 reactions for the final. Its absurd the stuff he is asking on it. I have an A going in, I hope I will have a B+ after this test.

Always willing to help during office hours and tries to make class interesting. He puts a lot of slides emphasizing the material and they get to be redundant after a while thats why he flies through stuff that he has already gone through. Makes exams really similar to practice exams. Really nice guy!
