He said explicitly he had no interest in teaching the course, and would much rather work on his master\'s thesis. His slides were marred with errors to the point he himself could not understand what he wrote the night before."

He was condescending, used a lot of jargon, discussed and used many theories and examples beyond 2nd year level leaving students confused. Seemed hard to relate to his students and often made mistakes on his slides. His carelessness, condescending demeanor and offhand remarks made class dull and was disrespectful"

I cannot even count how many sarcastic/snide remarks he made about the class and how he wished he were elsewhere. Don\'t bother asking him for help unless you want to feel like you are stupid. AVOID! Take this course with another professor."

He is constantly sighing heavily and reminding us that this is an incredibly boring subject- real motivating. He also explains more than is necessary(not in a good way), making it even more confusing. Avoid!!!"

Class isn\'t that hard. if you dont study what do you expect? i got a B+ because i constantly went to the lab for all assigments - easy 100%. Try to go to lectures even though you dont have to.. it stil helps. He will probably get better at explaining concepts. Made a lot of mistakes, but He\'s Hot :)"

The class is difficult but if you go to the lab you will do fine. Peter is helpful! If you use the lab for assignments you\'ll get 100% plus it\'s good study prep for exams. exams are difficult. If you dont study you will fail. you dont have to attend class to do well. Just study study study...

If people did poorly it wasn\'t for Peter\'s lack of effort! The only people I saw complaining about marks where the ones that never attended lecture and never bothered to go to the lab.

Makes countless mistakes on notes, study sheets, and EXAMS. Thinks it\'s funny when he has to to correct his errors during exam. Makes it very stressful!

He lacks preparation prior to class, notes are riddled with spelling/grammatical/conceptional errors, and he expresses his disinterest in being there. Lazy and unmotivated to help students as well. If you can, avoid this man feverishly; take psych 210 with another prof."

He teaches stats to art majors and it is nearly impossible to understand what he is saying. He makes the concepts so much more difficult than it needs to be. If you can, take it with someone else. His tests aren\'t much better nor is the text book."
