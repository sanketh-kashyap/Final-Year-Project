His class was super easy, only 5 essays and a couple of quizzes throughout the year which wasn\'t too bad! Attendance isn\'t mandatory, he does give you a few chances. Overall, great man! Definitely recommend his class."

When he takes attendance, he asks questions about a topic and that pretty much the participation. Professor Wright does assign readings for quizzes but they\'re so easy if you read. Definitely recommend!"

He has a great sense of humor. He understands when things come up, but don\'t take advantage. Only wrote 3 papers and 1 revision. He never cancels class but his classes are fun, makes you want to go. Use the water and culture reader and sometimes the penguin handbook."

As long as you attend class and put a little effort into your papers you\'ll be fine. He understands if something comes up, but don\'t lie. There\'s an end of the semester presentation. Very straight forward."
