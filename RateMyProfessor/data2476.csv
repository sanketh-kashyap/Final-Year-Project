He is truly truly an amazing person and teacher. I\'ve taken three classes with him and I\'m so thankful to know him. His courses have changed my life in the best way, and I highly recommend everyone take at least one class with Brandon before they graduate! He is the definition of an amazing human!"

I love this class and this professor. He was amazing and definitely inspired me to get out of my comfort zone and DANCE. Let me just say this, I am not the best dancer, BUT it doesn\'t matter. He makes you feel comfortable and overall just a fun class. TAKE HIM."

The class was very fun and was a great stress reliever. It was a good workout with the warm ups and the choreography. He makes the class really enjoyable and wants everyone to be creative. He grades based on attendance and effort.

All you have to do is try and your guarenteed an A even if you can\'t dance. His style is one of a kind and students are invited to watch him perform,must go.No book used and no hw.easy"

His moves will become a little repetitive. I would highly recommend his class for newly starting dancers.
