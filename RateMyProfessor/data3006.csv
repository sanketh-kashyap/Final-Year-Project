Johnson  Robert,University of West Florida,Philosophy department, Pensacola, FL,0,3.5,N/A,2.5,,2,05/06/2009,PHI2100,2.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Bobby\'s class was so boring! It was easy but so boring if you don\'t like philosophy. There was only one test and that was the exam. If you take his class make sure you do all the hw assignments and read the articles. He tests you on the articles on the exam. But he is BORINGGGG!

However Bobby is a great instructor. He trys to make everything as easy as possible so you can pass the class.
