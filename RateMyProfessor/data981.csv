I have been in his class for about 2 months now, and honestly have not learned anything. Stat is supposed to not be a very hard class, however he does nothing but confuse me. I am having to go get tutored after class to learn what going on, and I made an A in Math1111"

Don\'t listen to those other people. They probably just didn\'t do the homework. He will always answer your questions and stick with you until you understand, if not you can go to his office and he\'ll personally help you. He takes his test question directly from HW & Chapter tests. I am NOT GOOD AT MATH and made a B!"

What he teaches in class is usually not on the homework. If you like to teach yourself math go for it.
