She\'s very clear with everything she teaches. I\'m not gonna say it\'s an easy class because learning a new language is normally hard, but she makes it easy to understand and enjoyable. She motivated me to move on to CHN114! There are 7 HW and 7 Quizzes, 1 after each textbook chapter."

She talks very slow with Chinese accent but you would be able to understand what she\'s trying to explain. There are 7 quizzes in total and aren\'t hard if you study well. She is expecting you to do the homework and you should not take this class if you don\'t want to put any efforts.

You have to work hard for your grade so if you\'re in this course for an easy A I suggest you look elsewhere. Chinese is a hard language to learn but she makes the quizzes and tests a little easier for you by having a review sheet and they are almost exactly similar. There is a quiz for every chapter and two tests just FYI
