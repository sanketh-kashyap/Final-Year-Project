Janelle  Leger,Western Washington University,Physics department, Bellingham, WA,5,2.8,N/A,3.4,,9,08/15/2014,PHYS224225,4.5,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,1,"Truly excellent instructor. She expects a lot of her students (read the textbook! solve her suggested practice problems!) but if you put in the time and effort you can get a lot out of her class. Tests are challenging + require you to think on your feet, but if you\'ve been practicing problems + reading consistently they aren\'t bad. Do the homework!"

Can get confusing because she skips steps in the algebra but all the examples are pretty much exactly what is on the test. Grade is based on average of four tests. When I went to her office hours she was a lot more help one on one than just trying to struggle through it in class.

She looks at the clock A LOT. Lectures are word for word out of the text, but she makes it more confusing. Don\'t have to go to class, but review days are good because she tells you exactly what you need to know. If you go to those and do the hw, exams are easy. She doesn\'t explain things or answer questions well."

She looks at the clock a lot. Lectures are word for word out of the book, don\'t really need to go to class. Review days are good, she tells you exactly what you need to know. Tests are easy if you go to review and do the homework. She can be very confusing, and she doesn\'t answer questions well."

People who get lost in the derivation process probably shouldn\'t be in the class, or at Western for that matter...despicable. Anyway, the tests are straight forward, no bull****. She\'s not about to break your balls with complicated equations on tests; just enough to make sure you\'re not some god damn idiot. Plus shes **** status;)"

Knows her stuff but gets the class lost in the algebra sometimes by skipping steps. The easiness of her tests makes up for everything else. 3 problems, one from each chapter that has been covered. The final is Cummulative."

A hard class but i feel her in class notes on the board were clear and easy to use. Her tests are hard but she\'s always avaliable for extra help. She\'s good at giving alternative examples if one has a question in class.

Derivations to equations don\'t make sense and don\'t bother asking question you\'ll be more confused then when you started. Bottom line if you want a good grade find a different teacher.
