Follow all rules on a rubric and he starts the grade off as a c. Made us draw boxes for half a semester and the other half was stick figures even though we had nude models in class modeling for apparently no reason. He actually stifled my creativity.

(2)  Respected (1),9,04/15/2014,ART141,1.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,3,1,John is by far the worst teacher I\'ve ever had. He takes himself far too seriously and acts like he\'s the greatest artist there ever was. He forgets that he teaches art at a college where art is taken to fill a requirement. His baseline grade is a C and gives D\'s like he\'s never heard of a GPA Take anyone else but him unless you\'re Picasso.

John is super accessable and his class was ALWAYS interesting! He knows his comics like the back of his hand and he\'s really fun and hilariously funny. I just wish the class went on longer! I still miss it..."

Descriptions to the class was INTRO to Drawing, but he expected work that should be hung in art galleries. Dont do it to yourself. Even if you like drawing or think you good at it, dont take him. He does not teach, all he does is tell."

But he\'s a tough grader, for no apparent reason."
