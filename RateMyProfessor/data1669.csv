He is somewhat knowledgeable about what he is ""TEACHING"". Not sure what we are supposed to do during class. Attendance is mandatory and he keeps his student until the end. He doesn\'t give breaks."

He doesn\'t really care when you turn you homework in as long as you turn it in and expects students to do the Tutorial and 3 assig. on each chapter. He gives a test at the end of each sect., but if you have done your homework, in each section: word, excell, access, you should have no problem passing this class"

When reviewing the next chapter, he has a bad habit of clicking pretty fast on the screens, your book would be more helpful, if you are not computer savy. Read your chapters and do 3 case works at the end of each chapter you should be Ok. He does give tests."
