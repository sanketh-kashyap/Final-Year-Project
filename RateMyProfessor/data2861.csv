Knows his stuff, and puts up with a lot out of his disruptive students graciously. Could do a little better with class discipline, but in a masters level class you would expect them to do this on their own."

Anatomy and ONE are fine in fact they are pretty darn good, but I would NOT take him again for Biology - he has no enthusiasm for the subject and reads out loud from the text book during 3/4 of the class (yawn)."

He spends the majority of class simply reading out loud from the textbook. Lame. This is a Masters Degree program, and this guy is reading out loud from the text book? I mean come on! If you ask questions he usually says ""I don\'t know"" and keeps reading. If you have a choice, choose a different prof."
