Joe  Trainor,University of Saskatchewan,Psychology department, Saskatoon, SK,0,5.0,N/A,2.0,,1,06/29/2010,PSY222,5.0,2.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Joe taught PSY 222 along with Tara and they were both fantastic! I usually have trouble paying attention in classes that are more than 50 mins long but that was never the problem in this class! They are extremely helpful and nice and their marks are fair. I\'m taking PSY 223 with them again and I can\'t wait! BEST DUO EVER!
