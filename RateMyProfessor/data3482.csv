I hate economics, and I managed an A in the class. I am a good student, and I really had to study to do well. He also gives extra credit opportunities, which you should definitely take advantage of. He talks about going to the bar like everyday. I somewhat enjoyed the class."

His tests are a bit harder than they the study guide makes them out to be. The first test the average grade was a low D. Take advantage of his office hours though. I started to use them for extra help and the class became much easier. He does tend to add in way to much info in lectures

He doesn\'t care if you\'re there or not and his exams are so easy that it is a breeze to get a ""B"". Drops exams and random grades. Head to class once a week, be pleasant, study an hour a week, get a ""B""."

Nobody has any idea what he\'s talking about. His exams come from god knows where- 80 was highest grade on 1st. No office hours. Find someone else, definitely don\'t take Warthog Bird."
