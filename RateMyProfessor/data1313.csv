Also we almost always got our of class an hour or 30 mins early."

The photos that he always goes absolutely nuts for are the most boring, like a close up of a wrinkled sheet of paper (no joke). Stay away from complex compositions if your looking to specifically please him."

The class always starts about 20 minutes after it\'s supposed to because he\'s always of doing something else. There\'s a lot of just sitting, waiting for him to get things going and it\'s frustrating since you pay a lot of money for the class. Things you learn in 5 hours could be taught in 3 hours."

Smart, handsome, and very talented!!! Take him!"
