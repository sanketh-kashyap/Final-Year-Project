Doesn\'t stop talking about Argosy or her pug dogs, doesn\'t teach a damn thing. It\'s an easy A but you won\'t learn a damn thing. Like prevoiusly stated, if you ask a question she\'ll answer it by asking you ""what do you think?"" You can get by just reading the book and teaching yourself, you\'ll learn more that way. Horri"

It\'s an easy A but it\'ll be a struggle to get through. Has no grasp of the material and if you ask a question the pat response is: ""what do you think?"" Should not be teaching."
