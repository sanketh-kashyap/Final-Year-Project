YOU WON\'T PASS.  HILARIOUS,0,0,This guy is a complete G. He explains what needs to be explained and if you need help then he\'ll help you. Besides those two things this guy actually seems to have personality besides just being a professor. He\'s cool and funny and that makes chem a lot more fun to learn.

His powerpoints were organized with a lot of examples. He lists more textbook examples, but the book is not necessary. You do need a clicker to answer questions in class. Not a lot of opportunities for points besides exams, so take advantage of every point offered! Definitely recommend!"

He gives review packets out before each exam that resemble exam questions. If you\'re close on a grade, he will bump you. I went in not knowing much chemistry other than 110 and left knowing a lot more. He\'s a great guy."
