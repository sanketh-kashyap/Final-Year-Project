Doesn\'t prepare you much for projects and very unclear on expectations. Definitely don\'t recommend if you aren\'t already proficient in photoshop.

PARTICIPATION MATTERS,0,0,The class isn\'t horrible but I found it irrelevant unless you are some sort of graphic design or art major. She talked wayyyy to much and the workload was over kill for the fact that this class is a design elective.

She was always willing to help or explain something that you don\'t understand. I loved her class, but you definitely need to work hard and keep up on the work load. There will be a lot of work, but the end portfolio is definitely worth it. As long as you keep up on the assignments at the beginning, you\'ll be ok"

Professor Savage is very helpful if you are having a hard time. There isn\'t to much homework besides your creative thoughts and readings that you can use on quizzes. The class was an easy A I recommend it!

Literally a quiz every class almost on book readings that are a waste of my time to read , not in terms of doing well on the quiz\'s, but as far as overall content learned, they are useless. Could be a lot better."

She has a by-the-book / conformist personality, yet tries to teach creativity. Uggh, I was sick of her class after a week."
