Kimberly  Morgan,Southern New Hampshire University,Economics department, Manchester, NH,1,2.2,N/A,3.0,,3,02/26/2010,ECO301,1.5,5.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Professor Morgan is a nice enough person, but she is not an effective educator. This class was absurdly difficult, and yet no significant instruction was provided. Professor Morgan was absent for days and rarely contributed meaningful information. Her quizzes are tough, although she\'ll boost your grade if you write with objections. Bad experience."

There is a quiz every week, but it is not timed which helps a lot. A reasonable work load. Little to no involvement by the professor. An okay class to take if you do plan to major in economics."

As long as the discussion boards are done every week, you will get a good grade. The quizzes are pretty difficult, but she usually curves them."
