He was very helpful, and he is very intelligent; he was my favorite teacher so far. I was alwaysexcited to go to his class. If he ever teaches another class, I will take it. He is the BEST."

First of all he will teach you that Communism, for example, is just a political system. If you are willing to accept the world, then he will open up your eyes. Great Professor, take him if you can filter through a slight accent. He is a great Professor!"

However, if a student is struggling in a class but shows a clear willingness to learn, he will not hesitate to assist them. His classes require students to do their own work and hard work is rewarded."

Argues with students on petty details missing the overall point. Dry and monotone voice. very smart but has trouble expressing his intelligence in a group setting where he comes off more annoying than helpful. would not recommend his class. Plays favorites. Doesn\'t like students who disagree.

He is willing to help as long as we are trying our best. He explains the concepts clearly and makes the class fun. He is very knowledgable and gives homework. He also responds to email quickly if the student has questions. You will learn a lot in his class, and I would recommend him for anyone taking this course."

He is a total idiot and deserves to have his teaching cert. taken away. He is a communist who tried to justify 9/11 saying ""Can you blame them."" I think I walked out more times in his class then I actually stayed."
