I emailed this professor to inquire about when grades would be posted on the moodle page and she lashed out at me saying how i was being rude and inappropriate. She did not seem to be a very happy person and it reflected in her attitude.

However, she reads through the material on the slides and goes quite fast. She really doesn\'t answer questions that are ask she side steps them completely. She does have a good slide presentation but she doesn\'t consider that some people don\'t understand whats going on."
