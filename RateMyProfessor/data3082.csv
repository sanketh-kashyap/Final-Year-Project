If you do not ask questions, she will assume that you know the material and move on with her lectures. Her teaching techniques are not easy. She moves fast and her exams are somewhat difficult. If you decide to take her class be prepared to work hard."

At first she seems rude or bored but I could understand everything with a one time explanation. Very few homework and 4 exams ( 1 dropped ). The only thing that counts is exams and the final. Would definitely take her again!!

The textbook was the only thing that saved me in this class. I basically taught myself. The homework was all from the textbook and helped on the test. No forgiveness on anything. Just tests and that\'s it. Expect to learn everything on your own.

Does little in terms of explaining concepts. She allows all formulas to be brought to the tests on note paper, so if you know how to use them then they are relatively easy."

Stats is hard but if you do all of the short homework and attend the hour long lessons (that she usually ends early) and study for exams, she will try to guide you to a good understanding and a good grade. i liked her"

Also she skipped alot of sections we were SUPPOSED to cover for our next class"
