She is really nice, and a fun teacher, but she is not the best teacher and she is really easy. I like her a lot though. Last semester i got 90 extra credit points when the total points for the class was 450. Thats a lot of extra credit! I reccomend if you want to get an easy grade, but have fun and learn some german."
