GET READY TO READ,0,0,"This professsor is terrible. She talks over everyone, including the guest speakers and students asking questions. She is condescending and refuses to hold any proper discussions about the literature. She constantly talks about herself and her own work, in a bragging kind of way. Very rude. Expected better. She has ruined the CW department for me."

I had a hard time comprehending some of the literature, but overall they were interesting. She explains the texts well and she breaks us up into small groups often to further discuss the literature. Not a bad class, just be prepared to read!"

Gelineau\'s a clear and interesting lecturer- I don\'t like the subject but I always enjoyed her explanations of it. She gives great feedback re: essay outlines and the Bb discussions. People who can\'t handle it give English majors a bad name!"

She assigns a lot of reading and I was overwhelmed when I didn\'t leave myself a lot of time to get work done for her class. She\'s friendly, instructive and her lectures were always interesting, if a little dry. I would recommend her class."

She really does push her students and certainly puts in the hours. I would recommend her classes, although you must be prepared to do the reading to keep up with the volume of work she sets. However, a truly rewarding class."

Whoever gave this woman a job didn\'t realize that she would go mad with power. She takes herself and her awful class far too seriously. If avoiding her means jumping out of a building... well, you get the idea."
