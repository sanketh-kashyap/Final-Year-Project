Unfortunately for econ students, you roll the dice when it comes to taking econ 311/312 because it\'s either him or another prof. Lee is a tremendously nice guy AND knows his stats very well, but his teaching it is terrible. Its the language barrier but I just don\'t understand SFSU\'s hiring practices."

The only time he did a good job of teaching was when the econ dept. chair sat in during the lecture because the class before we had done evaluations and they apparently weren\'t good."

He posts sample mid-terms and finals that cover the content of the exam at least three weeks before the exam.

Not to mention, he does not speak fluent English. In addition, it is even harder to understand the course materials, due to lack of samples and again fluent expression of the materials. Moreover, this class will require much practice and studying."
