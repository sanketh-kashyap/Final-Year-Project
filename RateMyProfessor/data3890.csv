His examples ramble on to the point that the purpose of the example is unclear. The grading is based off of what he wants, not what is written, so be very aware of that. Don\'t expect an easy A."

He curves assignments so the class average is 75 (if it is lower). He offers extra points on tests. I thought i had a B in the class... studied for the final. ended with an A. DONT CHEAT/DONT COPY PEERS

However, is willing to help when he can. His time is somewhat limited due to owning his own business. Come to class having read the lecture notes already. He is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and is able to answer any questions you might have. DO NOT CHEAT whatever you do!"

If you go to class and ask questions, you\'ll be okay. He curves if necessary on all assignments and is pretty fair in grading. Don\'t expect an A unless you work for it. Don\'t cheat and you won\'t have a problem with him."
