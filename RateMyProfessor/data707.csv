Thought-provoking class; she\'ll make you think and re-think what you thought you knew. Class was lecture with discussion throughout. Caring teacher, wants students to do well but makes them earn it."

She challenges students but it\'s because she wants them to think for themselves and to LEARN something in her class. As said before, READ. The quizzes are tough. Overall, however, a great professor."

Do your reading to do well on the quizzes. Extremely helpful and cheerful person. This class was very enjoyable and she is awesome. Do your reading, study for the tests, and listen in class, and you\'ll be set."

Don\'t raise you\'re hand for mere comments or suggestions: be clear, straightforward, and to the point. She keeps it fresh, but asks that you do too. Do the reading, you\'ll have quizzes."

The most important thing to her is that the students get something out of the class. A lot of reading, but it is an English class."
