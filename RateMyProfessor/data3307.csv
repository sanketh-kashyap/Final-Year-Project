GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK  PARTICIPATION MATTERS,2,0,"Amberly is a great professor who truly wants to help every student break out of their shell. You need to participate and prepare each performance in class. Every time you watch a play you will do a 10 question quiz. This class was a joy and so much fun. It is an easy A. Attendance is extremely important, do not miss more than 3 times."

She gives every student in the class feedback after every performance, and expects you to really put in effort while on ""stage"". Attendance is mandatory and buying the book was too. She really wants you to grow as an actor and get to know yourself more as well. I would definitely take her again!"

She IS however, an extremely tough cookie. She is a no-nonsense type of person and she doesn\'t take BS from ANYONE. But overall I learned a great deal from her. I will most definitely be taking the 138 class with her and Roger."

I caught bronchitis before auditions and the disaster began. She told me having bronchitis is no excuse and that she caught \'laryngitis\' during a show. Learn the difference. Still re-gaining voice, class is crap. Make sure you\'re a broadway actor or you wont make it in this class."

She is honest, professional, and demands hard work. If you are willing to bust your butt everyday and can take genuine helpful criticism you will grow exponentially. She is tough, but human. She understands personal limits and helps you to become your best."
