No? Well too bad cause that\'s how he does things. If you do not understand things from the get-go, you\'ll have a hard time in his class. Lectures are painful and his tests look more like English tests than a Stat test."

Writes and solves problems on the board but doesn\'t explain what he\'s doing and why. You basically have to teach yourself if you want to do good on tests and pass. Extremely unorganized and doesn\'t have a schedule as to when homework is due. He sporadically assigns it so you better be checking D2L and emails everyday.

I had to WD from Oneah\'s class last semester because it was so horrible.. Zhang\'s class is way more understanding when it comes to grades and questions. His homework is very straight forward. He has very convenient office hours and is really caring!

Uses power points and does examples but never explains anything. Don\'t bother asking him for help. He\'s a terrible prof. Stats is easy math but having him as a prof makes it difficult.
