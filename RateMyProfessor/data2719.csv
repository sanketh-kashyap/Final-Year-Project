There will be no class where you go with out a laugh. He is very passionate in teaching you everything he can about comics. You will work hard, not an easy class. But the artwork you pump out will be some of the best you\'ve done. And his critiques are awesome, you will be laughing the whole time."

He will work you to death, but you will be much, much better. He introduces you to more than most of the other teachers on the intro level. He is very passionate about his subject and students. I would recommend him to anyone."
