I felt like there was a lot of work in the class and for a while it didn\'t really connect to much for me, but then it came together and I felt like I learned alot. I would take more classes with this teacher."

She cares more about her students than any other prof at ECSU. She really listens to what the students are interested in and then kind of directs the class toward what the students want to learn. This is really good in an upper level course because it lets you learn about what you care about.

She\'s a great professor for serious students who really want to learn about the world & how politics effects all sorts of different things. When I was a freshmen I didn\'t like her, recently I figured out how much she teaches. It\'s not just multiple choice, you have to think in her classes."

In upper level classes de Vries really listens to what students are interested in and then takes the class in that direction. This is great because as a PSC major it\'s good to be able to investigate areas of interest and not just have to keep taking survey courses. She brings in speakers and cares about students\' experiences. THE BEST.

She is such a great teacher you don\'t even get how much you have learned until you hear yourself talking! Also, deVries will really help you find opportunities. There\'s a lot of reading, but it\'s college!"

The last one was tough. LOTS OF READING. LOTS OF CLASS DISCUSSIONS. Its not easy, but the classes are very interesting if your a political science major"

If your a poli sci major she\'s one of the best teachers. If you want an easy useless class just to get a good grade pick someone else to teach you

Knows way to much about the subject, and will make you look like a jack ass if you give an incorrect answer. She debates everything, it\'s a really good class and you will learn a lot about the world,etc"
