Gabriel  Valenzuela,Mt. Hood Community College,Foreign Languages department, Gresham, OR,1,4.6,N/A,1.6,,5,10/27/2010,SPA102,4.5,3.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Gabe is an extremely engaging professor, which is exactly what you need for an 8:00am Spanish class. From the word buenos dias until adios, he maintains a genuine enthusiasm and passion for his career. His in-class and at home assignments are almost always interesting, and usually lots of fun too. Take a class with him, you won\'t regret it."

Still, Gabe is fairly easy on the eyes and does make class fairly fun....sometimes he would slip up a bit and start speaking Italian (as he teaches Italian too) and that was REALLY annoying..."

He had a good balance of fun and learning. Of all the language teachers I\'ve had, he is by far the best. His style of teaching helped me retain the knowledge I was learning. He is also ridiculously good looking but that only adds to his other perfections. I agree with those who recommended him to me, and I highly recommend him!"

He made learning enjoyable and fun the whole time! I highly recommend him, not to mention ridiculously good looking, but that is not what made him good. He engaged the students and made learning fun. I learned so much more from him than any other language teacher. Seriously! He is the best!"

He is a bit too easy and very leniant. He can be taken advantaged of quite nicely. Great guy and great teacher, but I barely tried and got an A. I learned to understand Italian, but can\'t really speak it."
