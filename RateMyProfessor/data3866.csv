Crystal  Porter,Florida State College at Jacksonville,Nursing department, Jacksonville, FL,0,1.9,N/A,3.6,,5,11/03/2009,NUR1110,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"Took her back in the spring. Best Damn teacher ever. When she went to grade one of our projects there was some conflict in grading them, so it wasn\'t her fault. I did ok on mine, but everyone else did bad and bad mouthed her. Its not her fault they did so crapy... And yeah, she reads off the power points, name a teacher who doesn\'t."

Painful class and she does not like being questioned or challenged. Would not have continued in school if she was to be a future teacher."

Instructions for completion of projects kept changing - told one group of students one thing, another group of students something different. Did not know grading policy according to syllabus. Two words - NOT HELPFUL."

She gives no instuctions for care plans/projects and then fails the entire class when she grades the care plans. She will answer any questions you have re: the care plans but then she goes back on her word when it comes to actually grading them."

She reads pp slides verbatim, she takes your head off when asking questions. Face to Face she is nioe, but very nasty via email or BB. It seems to me that she makes you look dumb, because she doesn\'t know how to answer. To give her tenure would be a horrible mistake!!!!"
