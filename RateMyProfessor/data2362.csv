I got very frustrated with the pace of the class and I had to challenge he a lot to squeeze a decent lesson out of the class. I honestly don\'t think she knows THAT MUCH about business, she\'s pretty knowledgeable about marketing only. DEFINITELY OVERRATED as a teacher. But she really is a nice person"

She\'s so sweet and always happy, she reminds me of a younger version of Rose from The Golden Girls kind of :). She wants everyone to do well and understand the topics. You really have to try to fail this class. She\'s pretty nice about attendance, but if you go and listen to the lectures she lets you k"
