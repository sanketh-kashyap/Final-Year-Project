He is nice but demands the basic needs from his students. He does give a lot of work but more so watching videos, reading articles, going into your community for assignments or extra credit but the actual writing part is easy. HE HATES PLAGIARISM, do not even do it. His online class was fun and interesting."

Jumps around a lot as far as subject material. Doesn\'t assign too much homework, tests are MC. I wouldn\'t take him again, as he never really ""clicked"" with me as a teacher."

He sincerely enjoys the material and it shows through his lectures. Standard PPT lecture that is available online; Dr. Eret is easily accessible for clarifying questions and very flexible with deadlines and personal issues. Take his class - you won\'t regret it!

I think many students take advantage of his kindness, but if you really talk to him, you can learn. We\'re lucky at CoA to have a professor as intelligent and well-versed as him. I wish I had gotten to know him better! If you work in his class, you will learn some really amazing stuff!"

He also does not use a textbook--bonus! That said, his myth class should be renamed ""Oral Storytelling""--don\'t expect to do an in depth study of myths (gods, dragons, etc). Also, don\'t attend if you have a sensitivity to tragedy stories, as he seems strangely drawn to them."

He makes the subjects super interesting and class not boring. He uses power point slides and with videos and other activities to keep the class not boring. He is very knowledgeable of the subject. I would for sure recommend his class.

No textbook because he posts blogs to read which can be very lengthy but just do them. Tests are open notes and 2 projects which are somewhat related to the class. I may take another class from him
