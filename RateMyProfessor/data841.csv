I think Sasha tries to make sure everyone in the class is understanding the material; she works through examples that are similar to exam/hw questions with the class. She assigns hw every week, the questions are sometimes difficult but they are good practice for the exams."

Dr. Boldyreva isn\'t overly generous in her grading, but she is fair."

Group project seems easy but she is not generous in grading if the topic is not good enough. You need to watch lecture videos over and over again in some points. She does make harder to understand the already tough course. 6-7 homework, midterm, final and project all in pack."
