I had her for my Level 1 internship and she is awful. The seminars are a WASTE of time, nothing she talks about is useful at all! She cancelled 8 seminars. She was always late to the meetings and gave poor feedback on lesson plans. She is one of the worst teachers I have had at USF. DO NOT TAKE HER."

Is slow with grading (3 weeks for a quiz? Seriously!). 2 absenses causes you a B.. in an 8am class. She schedules all of her projects and assignments after spring break (1 is due every week from now-until the end of the semester). We are elemntary ed. NOT Art ed.

I am an good student, attend class, and do my assignments on time and I found her to be impossible. She does not give explicit instructions for assignments and marks off points if you miss something that was never specified in the first place! When you ask her her justification for a grade, she doesnt have one!"
