Her teaching style makes me WANT to go to class. By far the hippest faculty member of the department."

Her classes are always interesting, and she\'s very accessible. It seems that the students that don\'t like her class are the know-it-alls that want to teach the class themselves. Get over yourselves."

Her course ""teaching"" is a total crap shoot, (choosing ""Nick and Nora\'s infinite Playlist"" as a ""required viewing"" for Directing class???) Doesn\'t seem to take her job seriously"

I love her whole attitude. The kind of teacher you are pals with but still demands that you learn the material. uses great media to illustrate points.
