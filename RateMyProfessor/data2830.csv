Sudipta  Biswas,Arizona State University,Psychology department, Tempe, AZ,0,2.3,N/A,4.0,,2,04/06/2009,PGS325,3.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,1,0,"This is a very difficult class and requires a lot studying to receive a good grade. Biswas is a very nice lady (willing to help) and did give some extra credit opportunities, but it doesn\'t make up for the fact that lectures are VERY boring (given in the form of Powerpoints) and the tests are extremely hard because they cover a lot of material."

She doesn\'t seem to care what so ever about the class. The first test was 12 pages long...the multiple choice questions were okay but the diagrams and essays were impossible. Stay away from this teacher at all costs.
