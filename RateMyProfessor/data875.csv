Curses in German. No tests but 4 each class you have to learn the next topic and right it in your notebook, do MSDs for all the chemicals you\'ll use and finish the privious class report,hand it in on time. My 1st report I got 100 but then he changed it to 60 -""no partner\'s name"""

Attendance is a must so BE ON TIME! he deducts points for being late...But overall, his class is easy! All you gotta do is do the lab and lab report is just copying procedure from book. Easy A!!!"

One of the worst professors ever. Actually, that is giving him too much credit. Be prepared to learn everything on your own and scratch your head whenever things are marked incorrect on the exams. Save your time and take Orgo 2 with someone else."

Recites from slides, but when asked about the topic, can never give a clear answer. Tests are randomly marked with points taken off nonsensically. I was extremely frustrated because he doesn\'t realize that he\'ll say something that completely differed from the textbook. If you don\'t know it, you won\'t learn it."

If you are not good in chemistry..DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. The test and final exams are open book, but they are very hard. He doesn\'t teach well and he is very into himself. BEWARE"
