AMAZING LECTURES  CARING,1,0,Mr. Walraven is one of the only professors I will truly remember the rest of my life! My fianc\xc3\xa9 passed away while I was enrolled in his class and he went above and beyond to check on me frequently. He also worked with me on the assignments I missed during that time. He truly cares about his students and WANTS you to succeed in and out of class!!

Professor is very sarcastic and makes a lot of jokes. You are only allowed two unexcused absences before it affects your grade. Notes are easy to take, tests a fairly easy. If you watch the assigned videos, take notes, and show up for class you should get an A. I would recommend this class/prof."

Prof. Walraven knows what he\'s doing and he really likes class participation. He doesn\'t post his powerpoints online so make sure to go to class. His tests are not that easy but they\'re fair. Make sure to watch the movies he assigns because they\'ll be on the tests. Not a blow-off class but a good one!

It is so rare to find someone who is so knowledgable because of life experience and general intelligence and studies, and can effectively convey this information to students. He truly cares what his students learn, and is such a sweetheart!"
