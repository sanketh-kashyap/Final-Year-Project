I did not learn ANYTHING. She\'s very vague on her description of the assignments. She\'s a part time teacher so her attention is not focused on this class. She takes forever to grade the assignments and although she said she is willing to help, she is never there. She\'s a CIS professor, she\'s always having technical difficulties."

She seems interested in the subject matter, but does not devote any time to communication or grading. She made this class pretty aggravating and useless - which is a shame."

Seemed to be very unorganized. I took the online summer course. Nice person overall, but not the best instructor."

Overall good class."
