I mean I got a good grade in the class but you NEED to be there for every class once you miss more then 2 days she takes points off your grade. Her grading is really weird!! Tests are easy and only had 5 homework assignments that were easy. DO NOT TALK IN HER CLASS!!! she will move you or kick you out. I guess she\'s okay

Her class is easy and you don\'t need the books even though she assigns readings. You do 3 papers, a debate, and a midterm and final. Most of those are easy. She never sticks to deadlines either so if you turn in papers a week late you won\'t get points off. Her class is pretty tough to sit through twice a week because it\'s so boring. But overall it\'s an easy class."

Just ask for extra time on assignments and she wont say no.The class is really boring but she takes attendance so you have to sit through her boring unnecessary lectures. The work you do as in easy papers can be researched online. Take her for an easy A

She gives no curves and have alot of pop quizzes. That\'s why you must stay on top the readings. If you start to slip, she doesn\'t care. She\'s a fair grader."

Tons of pop quizzes and a lot of web and book readings. Her grading sucks. She gives u 100 pts at the start of the year and uses it as a decline balance. Example a 4 pt guiz: u get a 2 out of 4 ur grade is a 98. Or on a test u get a 16 out of 20 ur grade is a 94
