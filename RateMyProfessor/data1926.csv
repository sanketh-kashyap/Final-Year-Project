He is definitely a democrat and will talk about the issues that he cares about. Provides good discussion on those topics though and does not discriminate against different opinions. Upperclassmen... attendance is not really mandatory. I would take him again.

He tries to make his lectures entertaining and the material is decent. He does want his class to succeed. For his tests: study, do the study guide, and read the articles he give because there is probably an essay on it. Have fun!"

GRADED BY FEW THINGS,0,0,No extra credit offered so make sure you do awesome on the quizzes and especially the tests! We didn\'t use the textbook AT ALL so don\'t bother getting it. All material comes from lectures - make sure you attend class. He was pretty good for a general education science professor - I\'ve had some pretty bad ones.

Aka 3 weeks of cake work and an easy A to show for it. Tests are straight off of labs and powerpoints and the final is just the first test combined with the second section. Friendly, if a little boring. Field trips are frequent and can be dull but can also be quite the adventure haha. Only complaints: goes slow through material and says ""mmkay"" all the time haha. A laid back course and an easy gen Ed out of the way."

He is always willing to help though, but some of the class is self taught."
