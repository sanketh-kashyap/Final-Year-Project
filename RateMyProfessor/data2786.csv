Minna Re  Shin,McGill University,Music department, Montreal, QC,0,2.2,N/A,3.3,,3,03/31/2009,MUTH311,1.0,4.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,"She has a disturbingly condescending way of relating to her students. Her assignments are horrendously unclear; the instructions are so vague that it is nearly impossible to produce the results she\'s looking for. Plus she marks you poorly if you don\'t write exactly what is in her head. She should not be teaching anything, much less this course."

I also really like theory. She says the word ""actually"" FAR too often, but other than that is an engaging, energetic, stern lecturer. She sometimes belittles her students, but I find this humorous more than anything."

It can be very hard to understand her explanations and her use of the whiteboard is very disorganized. She has a wealth of knowledge yet has much trouble explaining clearly.
