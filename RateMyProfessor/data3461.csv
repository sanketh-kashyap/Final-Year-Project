Little socially awkward but very friendly and I honestly think the cheesy puns make class better. All assignments are openbook and online which is awesome."

I took him online and he emailed me back speedily if I needed anything. Other than that he\'s a very hard teacher that seriously requires critical thinking.

He is a nice man, funny sometimes. Not extremely hard but not easy either. In AH take notes & study, you should do good. In Design(only for majors) he is easier than the other Dteacher, if you get a bad grade on a piece you hav the option 2 redo it by the end of the semester 4 a better grade."
