She never gave any negative comments towards student artwork, she awarded us with constructive criticism which made us better artists. I got exactly what I wanted from her class, and it showed in my work. I enjoyed her class very much. I highly recommend her :)"

Just be prepare to bust ass."

It was my first art class in life so for me it was a great exoerience I tried my best and even sometimes she didnt like my work at the end I ended up with an A, you just have to do your work and make sure she checks on you so she doesnt give you hard time at the end, The sketchbook for her is really a priority so make sure you do it."

She needs to encourage students positively and make constructive not destructive critiques. It seems that she doesn\'t have enough experience to understand that each student has their own style and are creative in a different way than her. Let the students flourish with their own identity!"

For those of you looking for an easy A I suggest you just stay home and let the students whom want to learn have more attention.

She is never happy with your ideas or your final work, she loves to argue. She needs to understand that we are not in class to PLEASE HER, we are in college to learn.

She is very NEGATIVE.She\'ll critique your work instead of encourage. Nothing is good in her eyes. Art is a free form of expression and personal. Be aware when she gives instructions, she asks for something but in the end when you show up with the work she will said:I didn\'t ask for that, please re-do it. She doesn\'t have experience"
