Debra  Bratton,Gwinnett Technical College,Mathematics department, Lawrenceville, GA,3,4.5,N/A,2.0,,39,04/24/2013,MATH099,5.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,0,0,Mrs.Bratton is the most amazing math teacher!! She is extremely patient & wants her students to succeed. I took her for 099 & math modeling & would take her for every subject if she taught it. I had been out of school for awhile when I started back with her & she helped me gave me the confidence to continue on in my college career.

She does not have good control of the class though and some students tend to take advantage of that.

She has lots of patience. If you want to pass the compass, and a teacher who cares, I strongly encourage you to take her. Trust me... She even takes time out to show you how to use the calculator."

She expects you to remember every little detail you have learned from every math prior to this. Don\'t ask a question cause she will make you look dumb in front of thee class. She shows you how it\'s done in class but after that you\'re on your own. You pretty much teach yourself.

I had to teach myself and get a tutor for the class. She doesn\'t drop the lowest test grade like my 098 instructor did.

She basically reviews the work but expects you to already know how to do it. Consider going into 098 or try a different teacher. Textbook not needed, just my math lab code and Casio fx-"
